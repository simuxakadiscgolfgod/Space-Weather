<br />**Title of the image:**  Moon Eclipses Saturn
<br />**Description for the image:**  What if Saturn disappeared?  Sometimes, it does.  It doesn't really go away, though, it just disappears from view when our Moon moves in front.  Such a Saturnian eclipse, more formally called an occultation, was visible along a long swath of Earth -- from Peru, across the Atlantic Ocean, to Italy -- only a few days ago.  The featured color image is a digital fusion of the clearest images captured during the event and rebalanced for color and relative brightness between the relatively dim Saturn and the comparatively bright Moon. Saturn and the comparative bright Moon.  The exposures were all taken from Breda, Catalonia, Spain, just before occultation. Eclipses of Saturn by our Moon will occur each month for the rest of this year. Each time, though, the fleeting event will be visible only to those with clear skies -- and the right location on Earth.   Gallery: Moon Eclipses Saturn in August 2024
