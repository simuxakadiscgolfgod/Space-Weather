<br />**Title of the image:**  Zeta and Rho Ophiuchi with Milky Way
<br />**Description for the image:**  Behold one of the most photogenic regions of the night sky, captured impressively.  Featured, the band of our Milky Way Galaxy runs diagonally along the bottom-left corner, while the colorful Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex is visible just right of center and the large red circular Zeta Ophiuchi Nebula appears near the top.  In general, red emanates from nebulas glowing in the light of excited hydrogen gas, while blue marks interstellar dust preferentially reflecting the light of bright young stars.  Thick dust usually appears dark brown.  Many iconic objects of the night sky appear, including (can you find them?) the bright star Antares, the globular star cluster M4, and the Blue Horsehead nebula. This wide field composite, taken over 17 hours, was captured from South Africa last June.    Explore Your Universe: Random APOD Generator
