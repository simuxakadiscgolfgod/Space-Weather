 Explanation:  
On August 21, 1995 one of the greatest astrophysicists of modern times
passed away.  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar was a creative, prolific genius
whose ability to combine mathematical precision with physical insight
changed humanity's view of stellar physics. His most famous discovery was
that not all stars end up as 
white dwarf stars,
but those retaining mass above a certain limit - today known as
"Chandrasekhar's limit," undergo further collapse. His detailed
mathematical papers and 
books 
on a wide variety of astrophysical subjects,
including, for example, black holes, are classic references for research at
every level.  Obituaries are available from the 
University 
of Chicago Press and 
Reuters 
News Service, and a 
WWW page 
has been set-up to record personal memories.
