A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 09-Jan 11 2024 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.33         1.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 09-Jan 11 2024

              Jan 09  Jan 10  Jan 11
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There exists a slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storms over the next three days.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 09-Jan 11 2024

              Jan 09        Jan 10        Jan 11
R1-R2           45%           45%           45%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: A chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts, and
slight chance for R3 (Strong), exists over the next three days.
