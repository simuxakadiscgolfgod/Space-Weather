A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 19-Jan 21 2026 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 19-Jan 21 2026

             Jan 19       Jan 20       Jan 21
00-03UT       4.00         3.67         2.67

12-15UT       3.00         2.00         2.33     
15-18UT       3.33         2.67         2.33     
18-21UT       3.33         3.00         2.00     
21-00UT       4.00         3.33         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 19-Jan 21 2026

              Jan 19  Jan 20  Jan 21
S1 or greater   99%     50%     10%

Rationale: S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected on
19 Jan, decaying to a chance on 20 Jan and a slight chance on 21 Jan.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 18 2026 1809 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 19-Jan 21 2026

              Jan 19        Jan 20        Jan 21
R1-R2           65%           65%           65%
R3 or greater   20%           20%           20%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely and a
slight chance for R3 (Strong) radio blackouts over 19-21 Jan due to the
flare potential of multiple complex regions on the visible disk.
