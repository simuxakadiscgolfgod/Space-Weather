A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Aug 23-Aug 25 2024 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Aug 23-Aug 25 2024

             Aug 23       Aug 24       Aug 25
00-03UT       2.33         1.67         1.67

09-12UT       2.00         1.33         1.33     
12-15UT       2.33         1.33         1.33     
15-18UT       2.00         1.33         1.33     
18-21UT       2.00         1.67         1.67     
21-00UT       2.00         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Aug 23-Aug 25 2024

              Aug 23  Aug 24  Aug 25
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Aug 22 2024 1039 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Aug 23-Aug 25 2024

              Aug 23        Aug 24        Aug 25
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to M-class flare
activity are likely through 25 Aug, along with a slight chance for R3
(Strong) events, primarily given the potential exhibited by ARs 3790
and 3796.
