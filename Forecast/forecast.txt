A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 18-Oct 20 2024 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 18-Oct 20 2024

             Oct 18       Oct 19       Oct 20
00-03UT       2.67         4.00         3.67     
03-06UT       3.00         3.67         3.33     
06-09UT       2.00         3.33         3.00     
09-12UT       2.00         2.67         3.00     
12-15UT       3.00         2.00         2.00     
15-18UT       3.33         2.00         2.00     
18-21UT       3.67         2.67         1.67     
21-00UT       4.00         3.00         1.67     

Rationale: There is a chance of G1 (Minor storm) conditions on 18 Oct
due to a potential glancing blow from an eruption on the western limb
associated with the M2 flare from Region 3854 on 15 Oct at 1833 UTC.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 18-Oct 20 2024

              Oct 18  Oct 19  Oct 20
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to remain at
background levels with a slight chance for a solar radiation storm event
through 20 Oct as Regions 3852 and 3854 transit the western limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Oct 17 2024 0505 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 18-Oct 20 2024

              Oct 18        Oct 19        Oct 20
R1-R2           60%           60%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be at low levels, with moderate
levels (R1-R2, Minor-Moderate) likely on 18-20 Oct. There is a slight
chance for X-class flares (R3, Strong) through 20 Oct.
