A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 05-Dec 07 2023 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       3.33         3.00         2.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) levels are likely on 05 Dec due to continued CH
HSS influences in addition to the glancing-blow arrival of a CME from 01
Dec.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 05-Dec 07 2023

              Dec 05  Dec 06  Dec 07
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 05-Dec 07 2023

              Dec 05        Dec 06        Dec 07
R1-R2           30%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
over 05-07 Dec.
