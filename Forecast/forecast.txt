A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 16-Jan 18 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.67         2.00         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 16-Jan 18 2024

              Jan 16  Jan 17  Jan 18
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 16-Jan 18 2024

              Jan 16        Jan 17        Jan 18
R1-R2           30%           30%           30%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There exists a chance for R1-R2 (Minor) radio blackouts over
the next three days.
