A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 10-May 12 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       2.67         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: Isolated G1 (Minor) storming periods early on 10 May due to
negative polarity CH HSS influences and the possible arrival of a CME
from 05 May.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 10-May 12 2025

              May 10  May 11  May 12
S1 or greater    5%      5%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 10-May 12 2025

              May 10        May 11        May 12
R1-R2           40%           40%           10%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
over 10-11 May, decreasing to a slight chance on 12 May.
