A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 16-Dec 18 2025 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 16-Dec 18 2025

             Dec 16       Dec 17       Dec 18
00-03UT       3.33         1.67         5.00 (G1)

18-21UT       0.67         4.00         2.67     
21-00UT       1.67         4.33         3.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected on Dec
18 due to the passage of a coronal hole high speed stream.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 16-Dec 18 2025

              Dec 16  Dec 17  Dec 18
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 16-Dec 18 2025

              Dec 16        Dec 17        Dec 18
R1-R2           20%           20%           20%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts through 18 Dec.
