A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 7 (NOAA Scale
G3).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 14-Nov 16 2025 is 6.00 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 14-Nov 16 2025

             Nov 14       Nov 15       Nov 16
00-03UT       4.67 (G1)    2.33         2.00     
03-06UT       6.00 (G2)    3.00         1.67     
06-09UT       4.33         2.33         1.33     
09-12UT       4.00         2.00         1.33     
12-15UT       2.67         1.33         2.00     
15-18UT       3.00         1.33         3.33     
18-21UT       3.00         2.00         4.00     
21-00UT       3.33         2.33         5.00 (G1)

Rationale: G1-2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storming is expected during
the early periods of 14 Nov as CME effects linger. G1 (Minor)
geomagnetic storming is likely by late on 16 Nov due to recurrent,
negative polarity CH HSS influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 14-Nov 16 2025

              Nov 14  Nov 15  Nov 16
S1 or greater   40%     40%     40%

Rationale: A moderate chance for an S1 or greater radiation storm event
will persist through 16 Nov as AR 4274 approaches the western limb of
the solar disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 14-Nov 16 2025

              Nov 14        Nov 15        Nov 16
R1-R2           70%           70%           70%
R3 or greater   30%           30%           30%

Rationale: R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
low chance for an isolated R3 (Strong) event, through 16 Nov primarily
due to AR 4274s past flare history coupled with its current potential.
