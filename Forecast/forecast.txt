A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 08-Oct 10 2024 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 08-Oct 10 2024

             Oct 08       Oct 09       Oct 10
00-03UT       4.33         3.00         1.67     
03-06UT       5.67 (G2)    2.33         1.33     
06-09UT       5.00 (G1)    2.33         1.33     
09-12UT       3.67         2.00         1.33     
12-15UT       3.33         1.00         1.33     
15-18UT       3.33         1.67         1.33     
18-21UT       3.33         1.67         1.67     
21-00UT       3.00         1.33         1.67     

Rationale: G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storms are likely on 08
Oct due to lingering CME influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 08-Oct 10 2024

              Oct 08  Oct 09  Oct 10
S1 or greater   30%     25%     25%

Rationale: There is a chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton flux to
reach the S1 (Minor) threshold through 09 Sep due to the enhanced flare
potential from multiple regions near the western limb of the solar disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Oct 07 2024 1913 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 08-Oct 10 2024

              Oct 08        Oct 09        Oct 10
R1-R2           75%           75%           70%
R3 or greater   30%           30%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with
a chance for isolated R3 (Strong or greater) radio blackout events
through 09 Oct.
