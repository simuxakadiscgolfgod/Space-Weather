A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 9 (NOAA Scale
G5).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 11-Oct 13 2024 is 8.67 (NOAA Scale
G4).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 11-Oct 13 2024

             Oct 11       Oct 12       Oct 13
00-03UT       8.67 (G4)    5.33 (G1)    3.33     
03-06UT       8.33 (G4)    5.00 (G1)    2.67     
06-09UT       8.00 (G4)    4.67 (G1)    2.67     
09-12UT       7.33 (G3)    4.33         2.33     
12-15UT       6.67 (G3)    4.33         1.67     
15-18UT       6.33 (G2)    5.33 (G1)    2.00     
18-21UT       6.00 (G2)    4.67 (G1)    2.67     
21-00UT       5.33 (G1)    4.33         3.33     

Rationale: The geomagnetic field is likely to maintain G3-G4 (Strong to
Severe) conditions into 11 Oct if the Bz component continues to sustain
a southward orientation and connect well with Earths magnetic field. A
gradual recovery is anticipated on 12 Oct, with G1 (Minor) geomagnetic
storm levels likely in the early hours of the UTC day.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 11-Oct 13 2024

              Oct 11  Oct 12  Oct 13
S1 or greater   99%     99%     80%

Rationale: S2 (Moderate) solar radiation storm levels are expected to
continue on 11 Oct and begin a slow recovery through the rest of the
period. S1 (Minor) levels are expected to continue through 13 Oct.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Oct 10 2024 2230 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 11-Oct 13 2024

              Oct 11        Oct 12        Oct 13
R1-R2           75%           75%           70%
R3 or greater   35%           35%           35%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
chance for isolated R3 (Strong or greater) events, through 12 Oct. On 13
Oct, R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, while R3 (Strong
or greater) events remain at chance levels.
