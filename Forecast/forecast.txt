A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Apr 01-Apr 03 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Apr 01-Apr 03 2024

              Apr 01  Apr 02  Apr 03
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Apr 01-Apr 03 2024

              Apr 01        Apr 02        Apr 03
R1-R2           10%           10%           10%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: A slight chance for R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are
expected on 01-03 April.
