A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 09-Nov 11 2024 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       3.33         2.67         3.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 09-Nov 11 2024

              Nov 09  Nov 10  Nov 11
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: There exists a slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storms over 09-11 Nov due to potential from multiple complex regions on
the visible disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Nov 08 2024 0301 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 09-Nov 11 2024

              Nov 09        Nov 10        Nov 11
R1-R2           85%           85%           85%
R3 or greater   35%           35%           35%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
chance for R3 (Strong), over 09-11 Nov due to the flare potential from
multiple complex regions on the visible disk.
