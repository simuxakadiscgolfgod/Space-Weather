A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 29-Mar 31 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 29-Mar 31 2024

             Mar 29       Mar 30       Mar 31
00-03UT       2.33         3.00         2.00

18-21UT       2.00         2.00         2.00     
21-00UT       2.33         2.00         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 29-Mar 31 2024

              Mar 29  Mar 30  Mar 31
S1 or greater   30%     10%      5%

Rationale: There is a chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation
storms on 29 Mar due to the flare potential for Region 3615.
Probabilities decrease for 30 and 31 Mar as Region 3615 rotates beyond
the western limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 28 2024 2056 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 29-Mar 31 2024

              Mar 29        Mar 30        Mar 31
R1-R2           75%           75%            5%
R3 or greater   25%           25%            1%

Rationale: Due to the flare potential of Region 3615, R1-R2
(Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a chance for R3
(Strong), over the next two days. Probabilities decrease for 31 Mar as
Region 3615 rotates beyond the western limb.
