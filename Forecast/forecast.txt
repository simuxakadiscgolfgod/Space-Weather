Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 30-Feb 01 2025

              Jan 30  Jan 31  Feb 01
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 29 2025 0408 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 30-Feb 01 2025

              Jan 30        Jan 31        Feb 01
