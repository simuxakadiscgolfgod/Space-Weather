A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 30-Jan 01 2025 is 6.67 (NOAA Scale
G3).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 30-Jan 01 2025

             Dec 30       Dec 31       Jan 01
00-03UT       1.33         1.67         5.00 (G1)
03-06UT       1.33         5.00 (G1)    4.00     
06-09UT       1.33         6.00 (G2)    3.33     
09-12UT       1.33         6.67 (G3)    3.67     
12-15UT       1.00         5.33 (G1)    2.67     
15-18UT       1.33         4.33         2.33     
18-21UT       1.67         4.00         2.00     
21-00UT       2.67         4.67 (G1)    3.00     

Rationale: No significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are
forecast on 30 Dec. G1-G3 (Minor-Strong) geomagnetic storms are likely
on 31 Dec followed by G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms likely on 01 Jan,
all due to CME activity from significant X-ray activity on 29 Dec.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 30-Jan 01 2025

              Dec 30  Dec 31  Jan 01
S1 or greater   20%     20%     15%

Rationale: A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation storm event
will persist through 01 Jan given the current total disk potential.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 29 2024 0718 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 30-Jan 01 2025

              Dec 30        Dec 31        Jan 01
R1-R2           80%           80%           75%
R3 or greater   30%           30%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
chance for an isolated R3 (Strong) event, through 01 Jan as the
conglomeration of regions approaches the western limb and new,
developing regions rotate onto the eastern limb.
