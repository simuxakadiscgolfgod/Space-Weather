A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 28-Mar 01 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.00         1.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 28-Mar 01 2024

              Feb 28  Feb 29  Mar 01
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation storm will
persist through 01 Mar primarily due to the potential and location of AR
3590.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 28-Mar 01 2024

              Feb 28        Feb 29        Mar 01
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: A chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) M-class flares, and a
slight chance for R3 (Strong) X-class flares, will persist through 01
Mar primarily due to the current potential and past flare history of AR
3590.
