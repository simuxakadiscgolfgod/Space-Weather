A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 24-Sep 26 2025 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.00         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 24-Sep 26 2025

              Sep 24  Sep 25  Sep 26
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Sep 23 2025 1034 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 24-Sep 26 2025

              Sep 24        Sep 25        Sep 26
R1-R2           35%           35%           35%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1 (Minor) to R2 (Moderate) radio
blackouts through 26 Sep.
