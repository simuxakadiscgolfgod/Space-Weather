A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 20-Nov 22 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 20-Nov 22 2024

             Nov 20       Nov 21       Nov 22

21-00UT       1.33         1.67         3.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 20-Nov 22 2024

              Nov 20  Nov 21  Nov 22
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 20-Nov 22 2024

              Nov 20        Nov 21        Nov 22
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low, with a chance for
M-class flares (R1-R2; Minor-Moderate) activity and a slight chance of
X-class (R3; Strong) events 20-22 Nov due primarily to the flare
potential of Regions 3897 - which will rotate out of view by 21 Nov -
and Regions 3899 and 3898.
