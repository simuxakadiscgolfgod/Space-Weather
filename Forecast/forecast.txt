A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 05-Jan 07 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 05-Jan 07 2024

             Jan 05       Jan 06       Jan 07

18-21UT       1.67         1.67         2.33     
21-00UT       1.33         1.67         3.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 05-Jan 07 2024

              Jan 05  Jan 06  Jan 07
S1 or greater   99%     15%     15%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to remain
elevated above alert threshold through 05 Jan, gradually decaying to
background levels on 06-07 Jan.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 04 2024 0155 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 05-Jan 07 2024

              Jan 05        Jan 06        Jan 07
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: There is a continued chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate)
flares, and a slight chance for X-class flares (R3-Strong) over the next
three days (05-07 Jan).
