A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 28-May 30 2024 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 28-May 30 2024

              May 28  May 29  May 30
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 27 2024 0708 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 28-May 30 2024

              May 28        May 29        May 30
R1-R2           55%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   25%           30%           30%

Rationale: Occasional R1/R2 (Minor-Moderate) Radio Blackouts are likely
with a chance for isolated R3 (Strong) Radio Blackouts through 30 May.
