A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 02-Jan 04 2024 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       3.67         2.33         2.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are expected in response to the
passage of a transients solar wind features.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 02-Jan 04 2024

              Jan 02  Jan 03  Jan 04
S1 or greater   25%     25%     25%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 01 2024 1225 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 02-Jan 04 2024

              Jan 02        Jan 03        Jan 04
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor - Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
chance for strong or greater radio blackouts.
