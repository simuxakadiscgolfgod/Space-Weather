A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 26-Jul 28 2025 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       1.67         3.33         3.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm levels are likely on 27 Jul due
to potential CME activity.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 26-Jul 28 2025

              Jul 26  Jul 27  Jul 28
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 26-Jul 28 2025

              Jul 26        Jul 27        Jul 28
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for
M-class flares (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) through 28 July.
