A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 07-Jul 09 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jul 07-Jul 09 2025

             Jul 07       Jul 08       Jul 09
00-03UT       4.67 (G1)    2.33         1.67

21-00UT       2.00         2.67         1.67     

Rationale: Periods of G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm levels are expected
early on 07 July due to sustained, yet weakening, negative polarity CH
HSS influence.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 07-Jul 09 2025

              Jul 07  Jul 08  Jul 09
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 07-Jul 09 2025

              Jul 07        Jul 08        Jul 09
R1-R2            5%            5%            5%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
