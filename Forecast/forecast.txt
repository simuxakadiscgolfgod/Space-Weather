A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 08-Nov 10 2024 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 08-Nov 10 2024

             Nov 08       Nov 09       Nov 10

18-21UT       2.33         3.67         1.67     
21-00UT       2.33         4.33         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 08-Nov 10 2024

              Nov 08  Nov 09  Nov 10
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storm on 08-10 Nov.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Nov 07 2024 0754 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 08-Nov 10 2024

              Nov 08        Nov 09        Nov 10
R1-R2           85%           85%           80%
R3 or greater   35%           35%           35%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be moderate with continued
M-Class (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) flaring and a chance for X-Class
(R3-Strong) levels 08-10 Nov. Solar flare probabilities are being driven
by Regions 3883, 3886, and 3889 due to their history and magnetic
complexities.
