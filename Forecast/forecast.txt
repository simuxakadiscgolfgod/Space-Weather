A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 19-Dec 21 2023 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 19-Dec 21 2023

             Dec 19       Dec 20       Dec 21
00-03UT       4.00         3.67         2.67     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    2.67         2.00     
06-09UT       3.67         2.33         2.33     
09-12UT       3.00         2.00         2.33     
12-15UT       2.67         1.67         2.33     
15-18UT       2.67         2.00         2.33     
18-21UT       3.67         2.67         2.33     
21-00UT       4.00         3.67         2.67     

Rationale: The geomagnetic field is expected to continue at primarily
unsettled to active levels, with early G1 (Minor) storming periods, on
19 Dec. Primarily unsettled to active conditions are expected on 20
Dec under positive polarity CH HSS effects, and any weak effects from
the 15 Dec CME. Quiet to unsettled levels are expected 21 Dec as
activity begins to wane.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 19-Dec 21 2023

              Dec 19  Dec 20  Dec 21
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 19-Dec 21 2023

              Dec 19        Dec 20        Dec 21
R1-R2           25%           20%           20%
R3 or greater    5%            1%            1%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low through 21 Dec, with a
chance for M-class (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) flares on 19 Dec, and a slight
chance for M-flares on 20-21 Dec.
