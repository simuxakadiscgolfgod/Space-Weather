A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 02-Feb 04 2024 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 02-Feb 04 2024

21-00UT       1.67         1.67         4.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 02-Feb 04 2024

              Feb 02  Feb 03  Feb 04
S1 or greater    5%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 02-Feb 04 2024

              Feb 02        Feb 03        Feb 04
R1-R2           25%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    5%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
for the next three days (02-04 Feb) due to the flare potential of AR
3567 and potential new regions rotating onto the visible disk.
