A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 25-Sep 27 2025 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         1.67         3.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 25-Sep 27 2025

              Sep 25  Sep 26  Sep 27
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Sep 24 2025 1913 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 25-Sep 27 2025

              Sep 25        Sep 26        Sep 27
R1-R2           35%           35%           35%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1 (Minor) to R2 (Moderate) radio
blackouts through 27 Sep.
