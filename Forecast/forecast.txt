A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 31-Feb 02 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.67         2.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 31-Feb 02 2024

              Jan 31  Feb 01  Feb 02
S1 or greater   20%      1%      1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms on 31 Jan as levels continue to trend downward
following the S2 (Moderate) event that began on 29 Jan.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 31-Feb 02 2024

              Jan 31        Feb 01        Feb 02
R1-R2           25%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
through 02 Feb.
