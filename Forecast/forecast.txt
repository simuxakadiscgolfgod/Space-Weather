A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 28-Mar 02 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 28-Mar 02 2025

             Feb 28       Mar 01       Mar 02
00-03UT       4.67 (G1)    3.67         2.67     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    2.67         2.00     
06-09UT       3.33         2.67         2.33     
09-12UT       2.67         2.67         2.33     
12-15UT       3.00         2.67         2.33     
15-18UT       3.33         3.00         2.33     
18-21UT       3.67         2.00         2.33     
21-00UT       3.00         2.00         2.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) storming conditions are expected early on 28 Feb
as CH HSS influence continues. By 01 Mar, a chance for G1 (Minor)
storming conditions remains possible as CH HSS influence persists, in
addition to potential for a glancing blow a CME that left the Sun on 25
Feb.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 28-Mar 02 2025

              Feb 28  Mar 01  Mar 02
S1 or greater   10%     10%      5%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1 (Minor) levels exists on 28 Feb - 01
Mar due to complex regions near the Suns W limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 28-Mar 02 2025

              Feb 28        Mar 01        Mar 02
R1-R2           55%           55%           25%
R3 or greater   10%           10%            5%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) events are likely, with a chance for
R3 (Strong) or greater events, over 28 Feb - 01 Mar. Only a chance for
R1-R2 events will exists over 02 Mar as most of the complex active
regions will have rotated beyond the W. limb.
