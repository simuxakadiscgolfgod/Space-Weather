A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Apr 02-Apr 04 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       2.00         4.00         4.67 (G1)

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 04 Apr under
negative polarity CH HSS influence.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Apr 02-Apr 04 2024

              Apr 02  Apr 03  Apr 04
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Apr 01 2024 0132 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Apr 02-Apr 04 2024

              Apr 02        Apr 03        Apr 04
R1-R2           20%           20%           20%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
