A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 10-Dec 12 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 10-Dec 12 2024

             Dec 10       Dec 11       Dec 12
00-03UT       3.00         2.67         2.33

21-00UT       2.67         3.00         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 10-Dec 12 2024

              Dec 10  Dec 11  Dec 12
S1 or greater   10%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 10-Dec 12 2024

              Dec 10        Dec 11        Dec 12
R1-R2           60%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely with a
slight chance for R3 (Strong) levels 10-12 Dec based primarily on the
flare potential of Region 3912 and 3917.
