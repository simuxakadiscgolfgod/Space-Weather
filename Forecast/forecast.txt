A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 21-Feb 23 2025 is 1.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         1.67         1.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 21-Feb 23 2025

              Feb 21  Feb 22  Feb 23
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 21-Feb 23 2025

              Feb 21        Feb 22        Feb 23
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for
isolated M-class (R1-R2, Minor-Moderate) activity and a slight chance
for X-class (R3, Strong) activity through 23 Feb.
