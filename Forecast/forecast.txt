A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 10-Jan 12 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 10-Jan 12 2025

             Jan 10       Jan 11       Jan 12

12-15UT       1.33         1.67         2.67     
15-18UT       1.67         2.00         3.00     
18-21UT       1.67         3.33         3.67     
21-00UT       1.67         2.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 10-Jan 12 2025

              Jan 10  Jan 11  Jan 12
S1 or greater   10%      5%      5%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation storming will
persist through 10 Jan as multiple CME producing regions transit and
exit the western limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 10-Jan 12 2025

              Jan 10        Jan 11        Jan 12
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   15%           10%            5%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely through 12
Jan, with a slight chance for isolated R3 (Strong) or greater events
through 11 Jan. This is based on the magnetic complexity and persistent
activity of Region 3947.
