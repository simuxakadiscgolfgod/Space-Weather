A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 09-Nov 11 2023 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 09-Nov 11 2023

             Nov 09       Nov 10       Nov 11
00-03UT       4.00         2.67         2.33

18-21UT       2.67         2.00         2.00     
21-00UT       2.67         2.00         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 09-Nov 11 2023

              Nov 09  Nov 10  Nov 11
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 09-Nov 11 2023

              Nov 09        Nov 10        Nov 11
R1-R2           10%           10%           10%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: A slight chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due
to M-class flares will persist through 11 Nov primarily due to the
current magnetic makeup and configuration of AR 3483.
