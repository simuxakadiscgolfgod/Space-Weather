Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 28-Sep 30 2025

              Sep 28  Sep 29  Sep 30
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Sep 27 2025 0714 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 28-Sep 30 2025

              Sep 28        Sep 29        Sep 30
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: Theres a likely chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts over 28-30 Sep.
