A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 03-Feb 05 2026 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 03-Feb 05 2026

             Feb 03       Feb 04       Feb 05
00-03UT       1.67         1.67         2.00     
03-06UT       1.33         1.67         2.00     
06-09UT       1.00         1.33         1.67     
09-12UT       1.00         1.33         1.33     
12-15UT       0.67         1.33         1.33     
15-18UT       1.33         1.33         3.00     
18-21UT       1.67         1.33         4.33     
21-00UT       1.67         1.67         5.00 (G1)

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm levels are likely on 05 Feb due
to possible glancing influences from the CME associated with the 01/2357
UTC X8.1 flare from Region 4366.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 03-Feb 05 2026

              Feb 03  Feb 04  Feb 05
S1 or greater   50%     50%     50%

Rationale: There is a chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton flux to
exceed the S1 (Minor) levels on 03-05 Feb due to the recent X8.1 flare
event from Region 4366 and possible future eruptions.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 02 2026 0036 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 03-Feb 05 2026

              Feb 03        Feb 04        Feb 05
R1-R2           80%           80%           80%
R3 or greater   40%           40%           40%

Rationale: Moderate to high solar activity due to M-class flaring
(R1-R2, Minor-Moderate) is expected for the next three days with a high
chance for occasional X-class flares (R3-Strong or greater) due to
expected further activity from AR 4366.
