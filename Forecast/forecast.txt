A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 04-Jul 06 2025 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jul 04-Jul 06 2025

             Jul 04       Jul 05       Jul 06
00-03UT       2.67         3.00         2.33

12-15UT       1.67         2.33         2.00     
15-18UT       1.67         2.33         2.33     
18-21UT       2.00         2.33         2.00     
21-00UT       2.67         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: The geomagnetic field is expected to reach to active periods,
with a chance for G1 (Minor) storming, over 04 Jul due to persistent CME
effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 04-Jul 06 2025

              Jul 04  Jul 05  Jul 06
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 04-Jul 06 2025

              Jul 04        Jul 05        Jul 06
R1-R2           20%           20%           20%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There exists a slight chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts over 04-06 Jul.
