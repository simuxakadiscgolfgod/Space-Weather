A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 01-Feb 03 2024 is 2.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 01-Feb 03 2024

             Feb 01       Feb 02       Feb 03
00-03UT       1.67         1.33         2.33

18-21UT       1.67         1.67         2.33     
21-00UT       1.67         1.67         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 01-Feb 03 2024

              Feb 01  Feb 02  Feb 03
S1 or greater   10%      1%      1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms on 01 Feb due to possible delayed response to a
far-sided halo event.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 01-Feb 03 2024

              Feb 01        Feb 02        Feb 03
R1-R2           25%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
for the next three days (01-03 Feb) due to the flare potential of AR
3567 and potential new regions rotating onto the visible disk.
