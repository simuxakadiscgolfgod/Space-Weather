A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Apr 25-Apr 27 2024 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Apr 25-Apr 27 2024

21-00UT       4.00         3.33         3.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Apr 25-Apr 27 2024

              Apr 25  Apr 26  Apr 27
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: There is a slight chance of an S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storm 24-26 Apr due to the favorable location and enhanced flare
probabilities of a number of spot groups.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Apr 24 2024 2259 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Apr 25-Apr 27 2024

              Apr 25        Apr 26        Apr 27
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
slight chance of an R3 (Strong) event due to the number of sunspots
present on the solar disk and increased flare probabilities 24-26 Apr.
