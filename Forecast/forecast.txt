A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 30-Dec 02 2023 is 7.00 (NOAA Scale
G3).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 30-Dec 02 2023

             Nov 30       Dec 01       Dec 02
00-03UT       4.33         5.00 (G1)    5.00 (G1)
03-06UT       5.00 (G1)    6.00 (G2)    4.33     
06-09UT       5.00 (G1)    7.00 (G3)    4.67 (G1)
09-12UT       4.00         5.33 (G1)    2.33     
12-15UT       3.33         4.67 (G1)    2.67     
15-18UT       3.00         4.33         2.33     
18-21UT       3.33         3.33         3.00     
21-00UT       4.33         4.00         3.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely, with a chance for
an isolated G2 (Moderate) period, on 30 Nov as glancing CME effects from
the 27 Nov filament eruption begin. Isolated G3 (Strong) geomagnetic
storming is likely 01 Dec as the CMEs from late 28 Nov, coupled with the
asymmetric halo event of 28 Nov, combine and arrive at Earth. Any CME
effects, although weakening, are likely to continue into the early
portions of 02 Dec providing G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming conditions.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 30-Dec 02 2023

              Nov 30  Dec 01  Dec 02
S1 or greater   15%     15%     20%

Rationale: A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation event will
persist through 02 Dec as AR 3500 continues to grow and trek west on the
solar disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 30-Dec 02 2023

              Nov 30        Dec 01        Dec 02
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: A chance continues for isolated R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) and a
slight chance for (R3) Strong radio blackouts through 02 Dec, primarily
due to AR 3500.
