A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 04-Jan 06 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 04-Jan 06 2025

             Jan 04       Jan 05       Jan 06
00-03UT       1.33         3.00         3.00     
03-06UT       1.33         4.67 (G1)    3.67     
06-09UT       2.33         4.00         2.67     
09-12UT       3.67         3.33         2.33     
12-15UT       4.67 (G1)    2.67         2.00     
15-18UT       4.00         2.33         2.33     
18-21UT       3.67         2.67         2.67     
21-00UT       3.33         3.00         2.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely 04-05 Jan, first
due to possible glancing CME effects from an event that left the Sun on
01 Jan and then to recurrent, positive polarity CH HSS effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 04-Jan 06 2025

              Jan 04  Jan 05  Jan 06
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation storm event
will persist through 06 Jan given the current total disk potential and
as AR 3939 approaches the western limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 03 2025 1139 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 04-Jan 06 2025

              Jan 04        Jan 05        Jan 06
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to M-class flare
activity are likely and a slight chance for R3 (Strong) radio blackouts,
exists through 06 Jan.
