A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Aug 14-Aug 16 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Aug 14-Aug 16 2025

             Aug 14       Aug 15       Aug 16
00-03UT       2.67         2.67         1.67

18-21UT       2.33         2.33         1.33     
21-00UT       2.33         2.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Aug 14-Aug 16 2025

              Aug 14  Aug 15  Aug 16
S1 or greater   10%      5%      5%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms on 14 Aug.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Aug 14-Aug 16 2025

              Aug 14        Aug 15        Aug 16
R1-R2           50%           45%           45%
R3 or greater   10%            5%            5%

Rationale: A high chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due
to M-class flare activity, most likely from Regions 4178 and/or 4172,
will persist through 16 August. Probabilities will begin to
decrease slightly on 15 August as Region 4178 exits the visible solar
disk.
