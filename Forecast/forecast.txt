A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 13-Feb 15 2024 is 6.00 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 13-Feb 15 2024

             Feb 13       Feb 14       Feb 15
00-03UT       3.67         4.67 (G1)    2.33     
03-06UT       4.00         4.67 (G1)    2.33     
06-09UT       6.00 (G2)    4.33         2.00     
09-12UT       5.67 (G2)    4.00         2.00     
12-15UT       4.67 (G1)    3.33         2.00     
15-18UT       4.33         2.67         2.00     
18-21UT       3.33         2.67         2.00     
21-00UT       4.33         2.67         2.00     

Rationale: G2 (Moderate) geomagnetic storming is likely on 13 Feb with
the potential arrival of multiple CMEs. G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming
is likely on 14 Feb as CME effects continue. Quiet to unsettled
conditions are expected to return by 15 Feb as an ambient-like
environment begins to prevail.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 13-Feb 15 2024

              Feb 13  Feb 14  Feb 15
S1 or greater   99%     50%     25%

Rationale: S1 (Minor) solar radiation storm levels are expected, with S2
(Moderate) levels being likely, on 13 Feb. Probabilities for a solar
radiation storm decrease to just a chance on 14 Feb, and begin to
decrease further on 15 Feb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 12 2024 0348 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 13-Feb 15 2024

              Feb 13        Feb 14        Feb 15
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to reach moderate levels with
occasional M-class flares (R1-2/Minor-Moderate Radio Blackouts), and a
chance for isolated X-class flares (R3/Strong Radio Blackouts), through
15 Feb.
