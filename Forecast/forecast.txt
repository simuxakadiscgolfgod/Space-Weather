A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 08-Mar 10 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 08-Mar 10 2024

             Mar 08       Mar 09       Mar 10
00-03UT       3.67         3.67         2.67

06-09UT       2.00         3.67         2.33     
09-12UT       2.00         3.33         2.00     
12-15UT       2.33         3.33         2.33     
15-18UT       2.33         3.33         2.33     
18-21UT       3.33         2.67         2.33     
21-00UT       4.33         2.33         2.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 09 Mar due to
glancing effects from a CME that left the Sun on 05 Mar.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 08-Mar 10 2024

              Mar 08  Mar 09  Mar 10
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 08-Mar 10 2024

              Mar 08        Mar 09        Mar 10
R1-R2           20%           20%           20%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A slight chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due
to isolate M-class flare activity will persist through 10 Mar primarily
due to the potential exhibited by AR 3599.
