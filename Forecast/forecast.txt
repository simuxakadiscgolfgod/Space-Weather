A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Aug 26-Aug 28 2024 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Aug 26-Aug 28 2024

             Aug 26       Aug 27       Aug 28
00-03UT       1.67         2.00         3.67

18-21UT       1.33         3.00         1.67     
21-00UT       1.33         4.00         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Aug 26-Aug 28 2024

              Aug 26  Aug 27  Aug 28
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation
storms are possible.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Aug 26-Aug 28 2024

              Aug 26        Aug 27        Aug 28
R1-R2           70%           70%           70%
R3 or greater   20%           20%           20%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to M-class flare
activity are likely through 26 Aug, along with a slight chance for R3
(Strong) events, primarily due to the potential from Regions 3790, 3796
and 3800.
