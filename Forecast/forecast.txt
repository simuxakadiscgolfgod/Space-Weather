A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 03-Jan 05 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 03-Jan 05 2024

             Jan 03       Jan 04       Jan 05

21-00UT       1.67         2.00         1.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 03-Jan 05 2024

              Jan 03  Jan 04  Jan 05
S1 or greater   25%     25%     25%

Rationale: There is a 25% chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms with a returning active region and elevated proton
flux.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 02 2024 1830 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 03-Jan 05 2024

              Jan 03        Jan 04        Jan 05
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: R2 (Moderate) or greater radio blackouts are likely from a
returning region near the east limb.
