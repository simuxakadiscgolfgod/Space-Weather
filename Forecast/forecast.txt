A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 26-May 28 2024 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.00         3.00         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 26-May 28 2024

              May 26  May 27  May 28
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 26-May 28 2024

              May 26        May 27        May 28
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for R1 (Minor) blackouts exists on 26-28 May as
Region 3679 rotates beyond the western limb.
