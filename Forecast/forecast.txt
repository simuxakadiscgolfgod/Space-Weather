A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 1 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 12-Dec 14 2023 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 12-Dec 14 2023

             Dec 12       Dec 13       Dec 14
00-03UT       0.33         3.00         2.67

18-21UT       2.67         3.00         2.00     
21-00UT       2.33         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 12-Dec 14 2023

              Dec 12  Dec 13  Dec 14
S1 or greater   10%      5%      5%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for an S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storm on  12 Dec.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 12-Dec 14 2023

              Dec 12        Dec 13        Dec 14
R1-R2           55%           40%           40%
R3 or greater   10%            5%            5%

Rationale: M-class flaring (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) is likely on 12 Dec,
with a slight chance for an X-class flare (R3/Strong), mainly due to the
flare potential of Regions 3511 and 3513. On 13 Dec, solar activity is
expected to decrease to a chance for M-class flares as Region 3511
transits beyond the SW limb.
