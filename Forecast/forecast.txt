A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 01-May 03 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown May 01-May 03 2025

             May 01       May 02       May 03
00-03UT       1.33         3.00         2.67

21-00UT       3.00         3.00         3.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 01-May 03 2025

              May 01  May 02  May 03
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Apr 30 2025 0751 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 01-May 03 2025

              May 01        May 02        May 03
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for
M-class flares (R1-R2, Minor-Moderate), and a slight chance for X-class
flares (R3-Strong) through 03 May.
