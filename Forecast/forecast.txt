A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jun 11-Jun 13 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jun 11-Jun 13 2024

             Jun 11       Jun 12       Jun 13
00-03UT       4.67 (G1)    2.00         1.33     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    2.33         1.33     
06-09UT       3.67         3.33         1.33     
09-12UT       3.33         2.67         1.33     
12-15UT       3.00         2.67         1.33     
15-18UT       2.33         2.00         1.67     
18-21UT       2.33         2.00         1.67     
21-00UT       1.67         2.00         1.67     

Rationale: A lingering chance for a G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic
storms is anticipated on Day 1 (11 Jun) in response to the passage of
the 08 Jun CME.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jun 11-Jun 13 2024

              Jun 11  Jun 12  Jun 13
S1 or greater   50%     25%     10%

Rationale: There is a chance for an S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storm on Jun 11-12 with the continued activity of Region 2697
as it rotates around the west limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jun 10 2024 1108 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jun 11-Jun 13 2024

              Jun 11        Jun 12        Jun 13
R1-R2           70%           65%           50%
R3 or greater   25%           20%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is likely to be at moderate to high levels
(R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) on 11 Jun with a chance for isolated X-class
flare activity (R3/Strong). For 12-13 Jun, there is a decreasing chance
for M-class flares with only a slight chance for isolated X-class flare
activity as Region 3697 moves further beyond the SW limb.
