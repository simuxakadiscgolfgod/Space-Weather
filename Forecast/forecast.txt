A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 07-Nov 09 2023 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 07-Nov 09 2023

             Nov 07       Nov 08       Nov 09
00-03UT       5.67 (G2)    3.67         2.67     
03-06UT       5.00 (G1)    4.00         4.00     
06-09UT       4.67 (G1)    3.67         2.67     
09-12UT       4.00         2.67         2.00     
12-15UT       1.67         2.67         2.00     
15-18UT       2.33         3.00         2.00     
18-21UT       4.00         3.00         2.67     
21-00UT       4.33         3.67         2.67     

Rationale: G1-2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storming is likely on 07
Nov due to lingering CME effects from a filament eruption that occurred
on 03 Nov, and negative polarity CH HSS influence.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 07-Nov 09 2023

              Nov 07  Nov 08  Nov 09
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 07-Nov 09 2023

              Nov 07        Nov 08        Nov 09
R1-R2           20%           20%           20%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A slight chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
will persist through 09 Nov primarily due to the current potential and
magnetic makeup for AR 3480.
