A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 29-Dec 31 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 29-Dec 31 2024

             Dec 29       Dec 30       Dec 31
00-03UT       2.33         3.00         1.67     
03-06UT       2.00         2.67         1.33

18-21UT       2.00         2.00         1.67     
21-00UT       2.67         2.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 29-Dec 31 2024

              Dec 29  Dec 30  Dec 31
S1 or greater   10%     15%     15%

Rationale: A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation storm event
will persist through 30 Dec given the current total disk potential.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 28 2024 1121 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 29-Dec 31 2024

              Dec 29        Dec 30        Dec 31
R1-R2           70%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   20%           25%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance for an isolated R3 (Strong) event, through 29 Dec. R1-R2
(Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are then expected, with a chance for an
isolated R3 (Strong) event, on 30-31 Dec as a complex of regions
approaches
the western limb.
