A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 16-Mar 18 2024 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.00         2.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 16-Mar 18 2024

              Mar 16  Mar 17  Mar 18
S1 or greater   75%     20%      1%

Rationale: S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms are expected to continue on
16 Mar with a slight chance on 17 Mar due to activity from old Region
3599 on the W limb.


C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 16-Mar 18 2024

              Mar 16        Mar 17        Mar 18
R1-R2           10%            5%            5%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
