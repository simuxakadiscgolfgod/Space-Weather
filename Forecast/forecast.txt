A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 24-Mar 26 2025 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 24-Mar 26 2025

             Mar 24       Mar 25       Mar 26
00-03UT       1.67         3.00         4.67 (G1)
03-06UT       1.67         2.67         3.67     
06-09UT       3.33         2.67         3.33     
09-12UT       4.33         3.00         3.33     
12-15UT       4.67 (G1)    3.67         2.67     
15-18UT       4.00         5.00 (G1)    2.67     
18-21UT       3.33         5.00 (G1)    3.33     
21-00UT       2.67         5.67 (G2)    3.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 24 Mar as CME
and CH HSS effects wane. G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storming is
likely on 25 Mar due to positive polarity CH HSS effects. G1 (Minor)
geomagnetic storming is likely on 26 Mar due to positive polarity CH HSS
effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 24-Mar 26 2025

              Mar 24  Mar 25  Mar 26
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 24-Mar 26 2025

              Mar 24        Mar 25        Mar 26
R1-R2           30%           30%           30%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for R1 (Minor) radio blackouts due to isolated
M-class flare activity will persist through 26 Mar.
