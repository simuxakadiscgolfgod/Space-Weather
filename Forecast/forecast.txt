A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 08-Feb 10 2024 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         3.00         2.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 08-Feb 10 2024

              Feb 08  Feb 09  Feb 10
S1 or greater   25%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a chance on day one for an S1 (Minor) or greater
solar radiation storms. There is a slight chance on days 2 and 3.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 07 2024 0331 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 08-Feb 10 2024

              Feb 08        Feb 09        Feb 10
R1-R2           60%           45%           45%
R3 or greater   25%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1 (Minor) to R2 (Moderate) or greater radio blackouts are
likely, with a chance for an R3 (Strong) event.
