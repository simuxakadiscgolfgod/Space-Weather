A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Aug 01-Aug 03 2024 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Aug 01-Aug 03 2024

             Aug 01       Aug 02       Aug 03
00-03UT       4.67 (G1)    4.00         1.67     
03-06UT       4.33         3.33         1.33     
06-09UT       4.00         1.67         1.67     
09-12UT       3.33         1.67         1.33     
12-15UT       3.00         1.33         1.00     
15-18UT       3.00         1.33         1.33     
18-21UT       4.00         2.00         1.67     
21-00UT       5.67 (G2)    2.33         1.67     

Rationale: G2 (Moderate) storm levels remain likely on 1 Aug due to
continuing CME passage and the anticipated arrival from the 29 Jul CME.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Aug 01-Aug 03 2024

              Aug 01  Aug 02  Aug 03
S1 or greater   35%     25%     25%

Rationale: A chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton flux to reach S1
(Minor) solar radiation storm levels will persist through 02 Aug given
ongoing limb activity primarily from AR3762 and AR3768.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jul 29 2024 0237 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Aug 01-Aug 03 2024

              Aug 01        Aug 02        Aug 03
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
chance for R3 (Strong) radio blackouts on 1-3 Aug, due to the number of
magnetically complex sunspot groups present on the visible solar disk.
