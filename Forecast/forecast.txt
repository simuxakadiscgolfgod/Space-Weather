A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jun 12-Jun 14 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.00         1.67         1.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jun 12-Jun 14 2024

              Jun 12  Jun 13  Jun 14
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jun 12-Jun 14 2024

              Jun 12        Jun 13        Jun 14
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is likely to continue at low levels with a
chance for isolated moderate activity in the form of low-level M-class
flares (R1/Minor Radio Blackouts) through 14 Jun.
