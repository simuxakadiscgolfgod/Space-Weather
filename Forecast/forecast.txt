A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 01-Nov 03 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 01-Nov 03 2024

             Nov 01       Nov 02       Nov 03
00-03UT       3.00         2.33         2.67     
03-06UT       3.67         1.33         3.00     
06-09UT       2.00         1.00         2.67     
09-12UT       1.67         1.00         2.67     
12-15UT       1.33         2.33         2.33     
15-18UT       1.33         2.33         2.67     
18-21UT       1.67         2.67         3.67     
21-00UT       1.67         2.67         3.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 01-Nov 03 2024

              Nov 01  Nov 02  Nov 03
S1 or greater   90%     40%     20%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to continue
at S1 (Minor) levels into early 01 Nov. The greater than 10 MeV proton
flux is expected to be elevated above background levels over 02-03 Nov,
but remain below event threshold.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Oct 31 2024 2120 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 01-Nov 03 2024

              Nov 01        Nov 02        Nov 03
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: M-class flares are expected, with a chance for X-class
flares, through 03 Nov.
