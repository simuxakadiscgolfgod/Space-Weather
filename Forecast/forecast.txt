A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 17-Jan 19 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 17-Jan 19 2025

              Jan 17  Jan 18  Jan 19
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 17-Jan 19 2025

              Jan 17        Jan 18        Jan 19
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: There is an increased chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts, with a slight chance for R3 (Strong) radio blackouts, over
17-19 Jan.
