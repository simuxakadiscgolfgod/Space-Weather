A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 24-May 26 2024 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown May 24-May 26 2024

             May 24       May 25       May 26
00-03UT       4.00         3.33         1.00

18-21UT       3.67         1.67         3.00     
21-00UT       3.00         1.67         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 24-May 26 2024

              May 24  May 25  May 26
S1 or greater   15%     10%      5%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for an S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storm due to the potential from Region 3679 over 24-25 May.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 23 2024 0216 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 24-May 26 2024

              May 24        May 25        May 26
R1-R2           60%           60%           40%
R3 or greater   10%           10%            5%

Rationale: R1/R2 (Minor/Moderate) radio blackouts are likely on 24-25
May with a slight chance of (R3/Strong) radio blackouts, due primarily
to the flare potential of Region 3679.
