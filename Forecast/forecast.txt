A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 1 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Apr 26-Apr 28 2024 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.67         3.33         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Apr 26-Apr 28 2024

              Apr 26  Apr 27  Apr 28
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) storms over 26-28 Apr
due tot he position and flare potential of several active regions in the
W hemisphere.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Apr 25 2024 1712 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Apr 26-Apr 28 2024

              Apr 26        Apr 27        Apr 28
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) events are expected, with a slight
chance for R3 (Strong), over the next three days.
