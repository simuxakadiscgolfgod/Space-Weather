A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 19-Feb 21 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 19-Feb 21 2025

             Feb 19       Feb 20       Feb 21
00-03UT       4.67 (G1)    3.00         1.67     
03-06UT       4.00         2.67         1.33     
06-09UT       3.00         2.33         1.33     
09-12UT       2.33         2.00         1.33     
12-15UT       2.00         1.33         1.33     
15-18UT       2.00         1.33         1.33     
18-21UT       2.00         1.00         1.67     
21-00UT       2.67         2.00         1.67     

Rationale: Unsettled to G1 (Minor) storming is expected early on 19 Feb
as any remaining negative polarity CH HSS effects end and a possible
transition to a weak, positive polarity CH HSS regime begins.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 19-Feb 21 2025

              Feb 19  Feb 20  Feb 21
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below R-scale thresholds.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 19-Feb 21 2025

              Feb 19        Feb 20        Feb 21
R1-R2           45%           45%           45%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for
isolated M-class (R1-R2, Minor-Moderate) activity and a slight chance
for X-class (R3, Strong) activity through 21 Feb.
