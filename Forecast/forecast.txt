A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 09-Mar 11 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 09-Mar 11 2024

             Mar 09       Mar 10       Mar 11
00-03UT       3.67         2.67         2.67     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    2.33         2.00     
06-09UT       3.67         2.33         2.00     
09-12UT       3.33         2.00         2.67     
12-15UT       3.33         2.33         2.67     
15-18UT       3.33         2.33         3.00     
18-21UT       2.67         2.33         2.67     
21-00UT       2.33         2.67         3.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 09 Mar due to the
possible arrival of the CME from 05 Mar combined with CH HSS effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 09-Mar 11 2024

              Mar 09  Mar 10  Mar 11
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 08 2024 2126 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 09-Mar 11 2024

              Mar 09        Mar 10        Mar 11
R1-R2           20%           20%           20%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts all three days.
