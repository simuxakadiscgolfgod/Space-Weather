A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 17-Oct 19 2024 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 17-Oct 19 2024

             Oct 17       Oct 18       Oct 19
00-03UT       2.33         2.67         4.00     
03-06UT       2.00         3.00         3.67     
06-09UT       2.00         2.00         3.33     
09-12UT       1.67         2.00         2.67     
12-15UT       2.00         3.00         2.00     
15-18UT       2.00         3.33         2.00     
18-21UT       2.33         3.67         2.67     
21-00UT       3.00         4.00         3.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 17-Oct 19 2024

              Oct 17  Oct 18  Oct 19
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to remain at
background levels with a slight chance for a solar radiation storm event
through 19 Oct as Regions 3852 and 3854 transit the western limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Oct 16 2024 0323 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 17-Oct 19 2024

              Oct 17        Oct 18        Oct 19
R1-R2           80%           75%           65%
R3 or greater   20%           15%            5%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be moderate to high due to
occasional M-class flares (R1-R2, Minor-Moderate) on 17-18 Oct, dropping
to likely on 19 Oct. There is a slight chance for X-class flares (R3,
Strong) through 18 Oct.
