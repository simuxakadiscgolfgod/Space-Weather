A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 29-Mar 02 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 29-Mar 02 2024

             Feb 29       Mar 01       Mar 02
00-03UT       2.00         1.67         2.67

15-18UT       1.33         2.67         2.33     
18-21UT       2.00         1.67         3.67     
21-00UT       2.67         1.67         3.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 29-Mar 02 2024

              Feb 29  Mar 01  Mar 02
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation event will
persist through 02 Mar primarily due to the flare history and location
of AR 3590,

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 28 2024 1855 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 29-Mar 02 2024

              Feb 29        Mar 01        Mar 02
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: A chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to
M-class flare activity, with a slight chance for an isolated R3 (Strong)
radio blackout due to an X-class flare event, will persist through 02
Mar primarily due to the potential exhibited by AR 3590 along with the
growth of AR 3595.
