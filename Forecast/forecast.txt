A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 7 (NOAA Scale
G3).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 04-Dec 06 2025 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

21-00UT       4.33         3.33         3.00     

Rationale: G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storms are likely on 04
Dec due to combined CH HSS and embedded CME influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 04-Dec 06 2025

              Dec 04  Dec 05  Dec 06
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 04-Dec 06 2025

              Dec 04        Dec 05        Dec 06
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   30%           30%           30%

Rationale: Isolated to occasional R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
are expected (75%) through 06 Dec, with a chance for a R3 (Strong) event
(30%), given past flare history and the potential of current active
regions on the disk.
