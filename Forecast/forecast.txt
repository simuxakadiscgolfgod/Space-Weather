A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Aug 05-Aug 07 2025 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Aug 05-Aug 07 2025

             Aug 05       Aug 06       Aug 07
00-03UT       2.33         2.33         1.33

21-00UT       2.33         2.00         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Aug 05-Aug 07 2025

              Aug 05  Aug 06  Aug 07
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Aug 04 2025 0457 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Aug 05-Aug 07 2025

              Aug 05        Aug 06        Aug 07
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts,
and a slight chance for R3 (Strong) or greater blackouts all three days.
