A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 14-Sep 16 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

18-21UT       4.67 (G1)    2.67         2.67     
21-00UT       3.67         3.00         3.00     

Rationale: The geomagnetic field is likely to reach G1 (Minor) storm
levels on 14 Sep due to CIR effects followed by negative polarity CH HSS
influences. On 15-16 Sep, periods of active conditions are likely, with
a chance for G1 (Minor) storm periods, due to continued negative
polarity CH HSS influences. There is a chance to see some weak influence
from the 11 Sep CME late 14 Sep through early 15 Sep as it passes in
close proximity to Earth.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 14-Sep 16 2025

              Sep 14  Sep 15  Sep 16
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 14-Sep 16 2025

              Sep 14        Sep 15        Sep 16
R1-R2           20%           20%           20%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low, with a slight chance
for an isolated M-flare (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate), through 16 Sep.
