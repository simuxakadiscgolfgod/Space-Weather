A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 12-Mar 14 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       3.00         2.67         3.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 12-Mar 14 2025

              Mar 12  Mar 13  Mar 14
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 11 2025 1304 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 12-Mar 14 2025

              Mar 12        Mar 13        Mar 14
R1-R2           35%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for isolated R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
will persist through 14 Mar.
