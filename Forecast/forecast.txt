A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 11-Dec 13 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 11-Dec 13 2024

             Dec 11       Dec 12       Dec 13
00-03UT       2.67         2.33         1.67

21-00UT       3.00         2.00         1.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 11-Dec 13 2024

              Dec 11  Dec 12  Dec 13
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 10 2024 0648 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 11-Dec 13 2024

              Dec 11        Dec 12        Dec 13
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely with a
slight chance for R3 (Strong) levels 11-13 Dec based primarily on the
flare potential of Regions 3917 and 3922.
