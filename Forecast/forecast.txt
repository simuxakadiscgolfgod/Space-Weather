A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 07-Mar 09 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       1.33         4.00         3.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 09 Mar due to the
anticipated arrival of a CIR and subsequent CH HSS.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 07-Mar 09 2025

              Mar 07  Mar 08  Mar 09
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 07-Mar 09 2025

              Mar 07        Mar 08        Mar 09
R1-R2           45%           45%           45%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate), with a slight
chance for R3 (Strong) or greater radio blackouts through 09 Mar.
