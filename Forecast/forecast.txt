A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 25-May 27 2024 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown May 25-May 27 2024

             May 25       May 26       May 27
00-03UT       3.33         1.00         2.00

12-15UT       3.00         3.00         2.00     
15-18UT       1.67         2.00         2.00     
18-21UT       1.67         3.00         2.33     
21-00UT       1.67         2.00         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 25-May 27 2024

              May 25  May 26  May 27
S1 or greater   10%     10%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 24 2024 0706 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 25-May 27 2024

              May 25        May 26        May 27
R1-R2           60%           60%           40%
R3 or greater   10%           10%            5%

Rationale: On 25-26 May, R1 (Minor) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance of R3 (Strong) radio blackouts, due primarily to the flare
potential of Region 3679. The likelihood decreases to just a chance for
R1 (Minor) blackouts on 27 May as Region 3679 rotates beyond the western
limb.
