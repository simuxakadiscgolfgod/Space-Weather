A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 18-Nov 20 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 18-Nov 20 2024

             Nov 18       Nov 19       Nov 20

21-00UT       2.67         2.00         1.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 18-Nov 20 2024

              Nov 18  Nov 19  Nov 20
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 18-Nov 20 2024

              Nov 18        Nov 19        Nov 20
R1-R2           50%           55%           60%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           15%

Rationale: A chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts will
persist on 18 Nov along with a slight chance for an R3 (Strong) or
great event. A likely chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
will persist on 19-20 Nov.
