A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 24-Oct 26 2024 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 24-Oct 26 2024

             Oct 24       Oct 25       Oct 26
00-03UT       2.67         3.67         2.67

21-00UT       3.33         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 24-Oct 26 2024

              Oct 24  Oct 25  Oct 26
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 24-Oct 26 2024

              Oct 24        Oct 25        Oct 26
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar flare activity is expected to be at Minor to Moderate
(R1-R2) levels 24-26 Oct with a slight chance for R3-Strong levels as
more magnetically complex regions emerge in the SE part of the disk.
