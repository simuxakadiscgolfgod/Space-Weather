A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 09-Feb 11 2024 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       3.00         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 09-Feb 11 2024

              Feb 09  Feb 10  Feb 11
S1 or greater   25%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation
storms on day 1, decreasing to a slight chance on days 2 and 3.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 08 2024 2350 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 09-Feb 11 2024

              Feb 09        Feb 10        Feb 11
R1-R2           60%           45%           45%
R3 or greater   25%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely on day one,
with a chance for R3 (Strong) events. Probabilities decrease to chance
and slight chance, respectively, for days 2 and 3.
