A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 03-Feb 05 2025 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

18-21UT       2.33         3.33         2.00     
21-00UT       2.00         3.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 03-Feb 05 2025

              Feb 03  Feb 04  Feb 05
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms over the next three days.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 02 2025 1404 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 03-Feb 05 2025

              Feb 03        Feb 04        Feb 05
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: Solar activity is likely to reach moderate levels
(R1/R2-Minor/Moderate radio blackouts), with a slight chance for
isolated X-Class (R3-Strong) events, over 03 - 05 Feb, primarily due to
potential from an active region cluster in the Suns NE quadrant.
