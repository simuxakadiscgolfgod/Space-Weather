A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 26-Jan 28 2024 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 26-Jan 28 2024

             Jan 26       Jan 27       Jan 28
00-03UT       4.00         4.00         3.00

12-15UT       2.67         4.00         3.33     
15-18UT       4.00         4.33         3.33     
18-21UT       5.00 (G1)    4.67 (G1)    3.67     
21-00UT       4.67 (G1)    4.33         3.67     

Rationale: Periods of G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely, with a
chance of isolated G2 (Moderate) storm periods on 26-27 Jan due to the
possible impacts of several nearby passing CMEs from events on 22-23
Jan. Active conditions are expected on 28 Jan with waning CME effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 26-Jan 28 2024

              Jan 26  Jan 27  Jan 28
S1 or greater   10%      5%      1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton
flux to reach S1 (Minor) threshold through 27 Jan - primarily due to the
potential and favorable location of AR 3561.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 26-Jan 28 2024

              Jan 26        Jan 27        Jan 28
R1-R2           45%           45%           35%
R3 or greater   10%            5%            1%

Rationale: There is a decreasing chance for radio blackouts as ARs 3559
and 3561 decay and rotate westward.
