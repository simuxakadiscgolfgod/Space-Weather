A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 30-Aug 01 2025 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       4.00         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 30-Aug 01 2025

              Jul 30  Jul 31  Aug 01
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 30-Aug 01 2025

              Jul 30        Jul 31        Aug 01
R1-R2           30%           30%           30%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: Solar activity is likely to be low with a chance for M-class
flares (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) through 01 Aug.
