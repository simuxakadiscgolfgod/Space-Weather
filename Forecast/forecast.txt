A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 25-Nov 27 2023 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 25-Nov 27 2023

             Nov 25       Nov 26       Nov 27
00-03UT       1.67         2.00         4.00     
03-06UT       1.33         2.00         4.00     
06-09UT       1.67         4.00         3.00     
09-12UT       1.00         3.00         2.00     
12-15UT       1.00         4.00         3.00     
15-18UT       3.00         3.00         2.00     
18-21UT       3.00         5.00 (G1)    2.00     
21-00UT       4.00         3.00         3.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 26 Nov due to the
combined influence from a positive polarity CH HSS and the periphery of
a CME that left the Sun late on 22 Nov.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 25-Nov 27 2023

              Nov 25  Nov 26  Nov 27
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation
storms exists due to the flare potential from multiple regions on the
visible disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Nov 24 2023 0933 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 25-Nov 27 2023

              Nov 25        Nov 26        Nov 27
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance for an R3 (Strong) event, throughout the forecast period.
This is due to the flare potential from multiple regions on the visible
disk.
