A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 22-Mar 24 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 22-Mar 24 2024

             Mar 22       Mar 23       Mar 24
00-03UT       4.00         1.67         2.33

21-00UT       2.00         1.67         4.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are expected to continue early
on 22 Mar as CME influences continue.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 22-Mar 24 2024

              Mar 22  Mar 23  Mar 24
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 22-Mar 24 2024

              Mar 22        Mar 23        Mar 24
R1-R2           45%           45%           45%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
