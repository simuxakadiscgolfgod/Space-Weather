A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 16-May 18 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       2.33         3.33         3.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm conditions are likely on 18 May
due to CH HSS onset.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 16-May 18 2025

              May 16  May 17  May 18
S1 or greater    5%      5%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 15 2025 1721 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 16-May 18 2025

              May 16        May 17        May 18
R1-R2           65%           65%           65%
R3 or greater   30%           30%           30%

Rationale: There remains a 65% chance that M-Class (R1-R2,
Minor-Moderate) level flare activity will occur through 18 May with a
30% chance for X-Class (R3-Strong) levels during the same time due to
the complex magnetic field within Region 4087.
