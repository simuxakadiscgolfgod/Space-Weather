A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 13-Oct 15 2024 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 13-Oct 15 2024

             Oct 13       Oct 14       Oct 15
00-03UT       2.67         3.67         2.67

09-12UT       2.33         2.00         1.67     
12-15UT       2.00         1.33         1.67     
15-18UT       1.67         1.67         2.00     
18-21UT       2.67         2.00         3.33     
21-00UT       3.33         2.67         4.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 13-Oct 15 2024

              Oct 13  Oct 14  Oct 15
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to remain at
background levels with a slight chance for a solar radiation storm event
through 15 Oct as AR 3848 transits the western limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 13-Oct 15 2024

              Oct 13        Oct 14        Oct 15
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
chance for an isolated R3 (Strong) event through 15 Oct.
