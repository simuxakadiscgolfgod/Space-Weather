A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 23-Jan 25 2024 is 6.00 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 23-Jan 25 2024

             Jan 23       Jan 24       Jan 25
00-03UT       5.00 (G1)    3.00         3.67     
03-06UT       4.00         3.00         3.33

09-12UT       4.00         2.00         3.33     
12-15UT       4.00         2.00         3.33     
15-18UT       5.00 (G1)    2.00         3.33     
18-21UT       3.00         1.00         3.67     
21-00UT       1.67         2.00         3.67     

Rationale: Periods of G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storms are
likely on 23 Jan due to the anticipated passage of a CME that left the
Sun on 20 Jan. Quiet and unsettled levels are expected on 24 Jan due to
waning CME influences. G1 (Minor) storm conditions are likely on 25 Jan
with anticipated arrival of the CME that left the Sun on 22 Jan.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 23-Jan 25 2024

              Jan 23  Jan 24  Jan 25
S1 or greater   55%     55%     15%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is likely to increase
above S1 (Minor) or greater levels during passage of an inbound CME on
23 Jan.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 22 2024 2121 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 23-Jan 25 2024

              Jan 23        Jan 24        Jan 25
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for R3 (Strong) or greater radio
blackouts over 23-25 Jan due primarily to the flare potential of
Regions 3559 and 3561.
