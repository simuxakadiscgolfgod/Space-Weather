A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 26-Nov 28 2023 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 26-Nov 28 2023

             Nov 26       Nov 27       Nov 28
00-03UT       4.00         4.00         3.00     
03-06UT       5.00 (G1)    4.00         2.67     
06-09UT       3.00         3.00         2.33     
09-12UT       2.00         2.00         2.00     
12-15UT       4.00         3.00         2.00     
15-18UT       3.00         2.00         1.33     
18-21UT       5.00 (G1)    2.00         1.33     
21-00UT       3.00         3.00         1.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm levels are expected on 26 Nov
due to the combined influence from a positive polarity CH HSS and the
periphery of a CME that left the Sun late on 22 Nov.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 26-Nov 28 2023

              Nov 26  Nov 27  Nov 28
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 26-Nov 28 2023

              Nov 26        Nov 27        Nov 28
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are
likely throughout the forecast period. This is due to the flare
potential from multiple regions on the visible disk.
