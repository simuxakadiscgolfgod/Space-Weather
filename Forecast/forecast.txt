A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 26-Oct 28 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 26-Oct 28 2024

             Oct 26       Oct 27       Oct 28
00-03UT       4.00         2.00         3.00     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    2.00         2.67     
06-09UT       3.67         1.67         1.67     
09-12UT       3.00         1.67         2.00     
12-15UT       3.00         1.33         2.00     
15-18UT       2.67         2.00         2.00     
18-21UT       2.00         2.00         1.67     
21-00UT       2.33         2.33         2.00     

Rationale: Periods of G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming are likely on 26
Oct due to possible CME effects coupled with CH influence.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 26-Oct 28 2024

              Oct 26  Oct 27  Oct 28
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to remain at
background levels, with a slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storms, on 26-28 Oct.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Oct 25 2024 0733 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 26-Oct 28 2024

              Oct 26        Oct 27        Oct 28
R1-R2           70%           70%           70%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance for R3-Strong radio blackouts, on 26-28 Oct as more of the
magnetically complex area of regions transits further across the SE
portion of the solar disk.
