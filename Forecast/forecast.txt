A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 08-May 10 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown May 08-May 10 2024

             May 08       May 09       May 10
00-03UT       2.33         1.67         2.67

12-15UT       2.00         3.33         2.00     
15-18UT       1.00         3.67         2.00     
18-21UT       2.00         2.67         2.00     
21-00UT       2.00         2.67         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 08-May 10 2024

              May 08  May 09  May 10
S1 or greater   25%     25%     25%

Rationale: There is a chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation
storms over the next three days primarily due to the potential from ARs
3663 and 3664.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 07 2024 1630 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 08-May 10 2024

              May 08        May 09        May 10
R1-R2           90%           90%           90%
R3 or greater   50%           50%           50%

Rationale: R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to M-class flare
activity are expected through the forecast period given the evolution of
ARs 3663 and 3664 as well as their recent flare history. In addition, a
high chance for an isolated R3 (Strong) radio blackout will persist as
well given AR 3663s history of X-class flares.
