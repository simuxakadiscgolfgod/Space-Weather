A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 07-Jan 09 2025 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 07-Jan 09 2025

             Jan 07       Jan 08       Jan 09
00-03UT       4.00         2.33         1.33     
03-06UT       3.33         2.67         1.33     
06-09UT       2.67         2.67         1.67     
09-12UT       2.33         1.67         1.33     
12-15UT       2.00         1.67         1.33     
15-18UT       2.00         1.67         1.33     
18-21UT       2.00         2.00         1.67     
21-00UT       2.67         2.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 07-Jan 09 2025

              Jan 07  Jan 08  Jan 09
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation storming will
persist through 09 Jan as multiple CME producing regions transit and
exit the western limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 06 2025 1624 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 07-Jan 09 2025

              Jan 07        Jan 08        Jan 09
R1-R2           70%           65%           60%
R3 or greater   25%           20%           15%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
decreasing chance for isolated R3 (Strong) or greater events through 09
Jan.
