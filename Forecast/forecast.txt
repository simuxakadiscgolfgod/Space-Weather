A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 22-Dec 24 2023 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 22-Dec 24 2023

             Dec 22       Dec 23       Dec 24
00-03UT       2.00         3.67         2.33

21-00UT       1.33         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 22-Dec 24 2023

              Dec 22  Dec 23  Dec 24
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 21 2023 0538 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 22-Dec 24 2023

              Dec 22        Dec 23        Dec 24
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There exists a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts over the next three days.
