A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 15-May 17 2024 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown May 15-May 17 2024

             May 15       May 16       May 17
00-03UT       5.00 (G1)    2.33         2.33     
03-06UT       3.67         2.00         1.33     
06-09UT       3.00         2.67         1.67     
09-12UT       2.33         2.33         1.67     
12-15UT       2.67         2.00         2.33     
15-18UT       2.33         2.67         2.33     
18-21UT       2.67         3.00         3.33     
21-00UT       3.00         2.33         4.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 15 May as CME
influence wanes.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 15-May 17 2024

              May 15  May 16  May 17
S1 or greater   99%     25%     15%

Rationale: S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms are expected on 15 May
14 May with a chance on 16 May and a slight chance on 17 May due to the
eruptive potential from now departed Region 3664.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 14 2024 1651 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 15-May 17 2024

              May 15        May 16        May 17
R1-R2           75%           40%           35%
R3 or greater   40%           15%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) conditions are expected on 15 May due
to the flare potential from now departed Region 3664. Probabilities drop
to a chance on 16-17 May from the remaining active regions on the Suns
visible disk.
