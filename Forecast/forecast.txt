A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 17-Sep 19 2025 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Sep 17-Sep 19 2025

             Sep 17       Sep 18       Sep 19

21-00UT       2.67         2.33         1.67     

Rationale:  There continues to be a chance for G1 (Minor) storming on 17
Sep as CH HSS effects linger.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 17-Sep 19 2025

              Sep 17  Sep 18  Sep 19
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 17-Sep 19 2025

              Sep 17        Sep 18        Sep 19
R1-R2           30%           30%           30%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for isolated R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts through 19 Sep.
