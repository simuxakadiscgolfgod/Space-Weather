A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 22-Jul 24 2024 is 1.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jul 22-Jul 24 2024

21-00UT       1.33         1.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 22-Jul 24 2024

              Jul 22  Jul 23  Jul 24
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storms through 24 Jul.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jul 16 2024 1326 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 22-Jul 24 2024

              Jul 22        Jul 23        Jul 24
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely through 24
Jul, with a slight chance for an R3 (Strong) event, due to multiple
complex regions on the visible disk.
