A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jun 30-Jul 02 2025 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jun 30-Jul 02 2025

             Jun 30       Jul 01       Jul 02

21-00UT       1.33         1.33         4.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 02 Jul with the
arrival of the 28 Jun CME.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jun 30-Jul 02 2025

              Jun 30  Jul 01  Jul 02
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jun 30-Jul 02 2025

              Jun 30        Jul 01        Jul 02
R1-R2           25%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to
isolated M-class flare activity will persist through 02 July.
