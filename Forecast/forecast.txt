A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 04-Nov 06 2023 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 04-Nov 06 2023

              Nov 04  Nov 05  Nov 06
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 04-Nov 06 2023

              Nov 04        Nov 05        Nov 06
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There is a continued chance for R1 (Minor) radio blackouts on
04-06 Nov as new spots rotate onto the eastern limb of the visible disk.
