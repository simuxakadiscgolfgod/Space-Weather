A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Apr 23-Apr 25 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       3.67         2.67         2.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) or geomagnetic storms are possible in response to
a recurrent fast solar wind stream affecting Earth.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Apr 23-Apr 25 2025

              Apr 23  Apr 24  Apr 25
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Apr 22 2025 1049 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Apr 23-Apr 25 2025

              Apr 23        Apr 24        Apr 25
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts.
