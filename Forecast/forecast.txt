A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 05-Jan 07 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 05-Jan 07 2025

             Jan 05       Jan 06       Jan 07
00-03UT       4.33         3.00         2.67     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    3.67         2.33     
06-09UT       4.67 (G1)    2.67         2.00     
09-12UT       3.33         2.33         2.33     
12-15UT       2.67         2.00         1.33     
15-18UT       2.33         2.33         2.00     
18-21UT       3.67         2.67         2.00     
21-00UT       4.00         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: Isolated periods of G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming are
expected on 05 Jan, first due to lingering CME effects, then to positive
polarity CH HSS effects. More ambient conditions are likely on 05-06 Jan
as CH HSS influence persists.


B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 05-Jan 07 2025

              Jan 05  Jan 06  Jan 07
S1 or greater   99%     25%     10%

Rationale: S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are currently
observed at the 10 MeV threshold. Radiation storms are expected to
continue into 05 Jan and decay to a chance on 06 Jan and a slight chance
on 07 Jan.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 04 2025 1248 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 05-Jan 07 2025

              Jan 05        Jan 06        Jan 07
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
chance for an isolated R3 (Strong) event, through 07 Jan as M-flares
continue and Region 3947 continues to evolve.
