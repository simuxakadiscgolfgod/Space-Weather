A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 20-Dec 22 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       2.00         1.67         4.67 (G1)

Rationale: G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected on Dec
22, due to the anticipated onset of a +CH/HSS influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 20-Dec 22 2025

              Dec 20  Dec 21  Dec 22
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 19 2025 1558 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 20-Dec 22 2025

              Dec 20        Dec 21        Dec 22
R1-R2            5%            5%            5%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
