A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 08-May 10 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

             May 08       May 09       May 10

18-21UT       2.33         4.67 (G1)    2.67     
21-00UT       2.67         4.00         2.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) conditions are likely on 09 May due to the onset
of influence from another negative polarity CH HSS coupled with a
possible glancing blow CME from 05 May.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 08-May 10 2025

              May 08  May 09  May 10
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 08-May 10 2025

              May 08        May 09        May 10
R1-R2           45%           45%           45%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: Region 4079s enhanced magnetic complexity will keep the
chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts in the forecast over
08-10 May.
