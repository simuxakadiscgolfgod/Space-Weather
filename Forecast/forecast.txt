A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 27-Mar 29 2024 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.33         1.33         2.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 27-Mar 29 2024

              Mar 27  Mar 28  Mar 29
S1 or greater   30%     30%     30%

Rationale: There is a chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation
storms over the next three days due primarily to the flare potential of
Region 3615.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 26 2024 1330 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 27-Mar 29 2024

              Mar 27        Mar 28        Mar 29
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) are expected over the next three days
due primarily to the flare potential of Region 3615.
