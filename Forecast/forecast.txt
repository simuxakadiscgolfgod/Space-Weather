A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 06-Feb 08 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 06-Feb 08 2025

             Feb 06       Feb 07       Feb 08

21-00UT       2.00         3.00         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 06-Feb 08 2025

              Feb 06  Feb 07  Feb 08
S1 or greater   25%     25%     25%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for the greater than 10 MeV protons
to cross the S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storm alert
threshold.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 05 2025 0750 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 06-Feb 08 2025

              Feb 06        Feb 07        Feb 08
R1-R2           85%           85%           85%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackout events are expected,
with a slight chance for R3 (Strong) events.
