A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 07-Mar 09 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

             Mar 07       Mar 08       Mar 09

18-21UT       2.00         3.33         2.67     
21-00UT       2.33         4.33         2.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 09 Mar due to
shock arrival and any glancing effects from a CME that left the sun on
05 Mar.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 07-Mar 09 2024

              Mar 07  Mar 08  Mar 09
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 07-Mar 09 2024

              Mar 07        Mar 08        Mar 09
R1-R2           15%           15%           15%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: A slight chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due
to isolated M-class flare activity will persist through 09 Mar primarily
due to the potential exhibited by ARs 3595 and 3599.
