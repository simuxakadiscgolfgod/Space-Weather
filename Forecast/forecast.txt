A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 12-Dec 14 2024 is 1.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.33         1.33         1.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 12-Dec 14 2024

              Dec 12  Dec 13  Dec 14
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 11 2024 1549 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 12-Dec 14 2024

              Dec 12        Dec 13        Dec 14
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely on 12-14
Dec based primarily on the flare potential of Regions 3917, 3920 and
3922.
