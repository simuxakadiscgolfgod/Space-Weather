A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 21-Dec 23 2025 is 5.33 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 21-Dec 23 2025

             Dec 21       Dec 22       Dec 23
00-03UT       1.67         1.67         5.33 (G1)
03-06UT       1.67         2.00         5.00 (G1)
06-09UT       1.67         1.67         4.33     
09-12UT       1.33         3.33         3.67     
12-15UT       0.67         4.00         3.00     
15-18UT       1.33         4.00         3.33     
18-21UT       0.67         4.67 (G1)    3.67     
21-00UT       1.67         5.00 (G1)    4.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 22-23 Dec due to
the anticipated effects of high speeds streams from a positive polarity
coronal hole that will become geoeffective.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 21-Dec 23 2025

              Dec 21  Dec 22  Dec 23
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 20 2025 0753 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 21-Dec 23 2025

              Dec 21        Dec 22        Dec 23
R1-R2           10%           10%           20%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts on 21-22 Dec, with an increased chance for such events on 23
Dec, due to returning active regions rotating into the visible solar
disk.
