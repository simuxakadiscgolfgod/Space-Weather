A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 24-Dec 26 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       4.67 (G1)    2.67         2.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected on 24
Dec due to persistent CH HSS influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 24-Dec 26 2025

              Dec 24  Dec 25  Dec 26
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 24-Dec 26 2025

              Dec 24        Dec 25        Dec 26
R1-R2           30%           40%           45%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There is an increasing chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) or
greater radio blackouts through 26 Dec.
