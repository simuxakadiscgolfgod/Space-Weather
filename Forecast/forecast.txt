A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 28-Mar 30 2025 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 28-Mar 30 2025

             Mar 28       Mar 29       Mar 30
00-03UT       3.67         3.33         3.00

18-21UT       4.00         3.33         1.33     
21-00UT       4.00         3.33         2.33     

Rationale: The geomagnetic field is expected to observe periods of G1
(Minor) geomagnetic storm levels on 28 Mar due to CH HSS influence.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 28-Mar 30 2025

              Mar 28  Mar 29  Mar 30
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 27 2025 0037 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 28-Mar 30 2025

              Mar 28        Mar 29        Mar 30
R1-R2           25%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There exists a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts over 28-30 Mar.
