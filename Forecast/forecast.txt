A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 1 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 27-Jan 29 2025 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.33         1.33         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 27-Jan 29 2025

              Jan 27  Jan 28  Jan 29
S1 or greater   10%      5%      1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms over 26-27 Jun.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 27-Jan 29 2025

              Jan 27        Jan 28        Jan 29
R1-R2           45%           35%           30%
R3 or greater   10%            5%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackout
events on 26-28 Jan, with slight chance for R2 (Strong) events over
26-27 Jan, due to the flare potential of multiple regions on the visible
disk.
