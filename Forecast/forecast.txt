A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jun 06-Jun 08 2024 is 3.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         1.33         3.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jun 06-Jun 08 2024

              Jun 06  Jun 07  Jun 08
S1 or greater   20%     20%     20%

Rationale: There is a chance for a greater than 10 MeV proton event
exceeding the S1 (Minor) threshold through 08 Jun, primarily due to the
flare potential of Region 3697.


C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jun 05 2024 0856 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jun 06-Jun 08 2024

              Jun 06        Jun 07        Jun 08
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   20%           20%           20%

Rationale: Occasional R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) Radio Blackouts are likely,
with a slight chance for isolated R3 (Strong) Radio Blackouts through 08
Jun.
