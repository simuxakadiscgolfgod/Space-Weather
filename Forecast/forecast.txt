A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 07-Oct 09 2024 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 07-Oct 09 2024

             Oct 07       Oct 08       Oct 09
00-03UT       5.00 (G1)    3.33         2.00     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    3.67         1.33     
06-09UT       4.33         3.00         1.33     
09-12UT       4.00         2.00         1.00     
12-15UT       3.67         1.67         1.00     
15-18UT       3.00         1.67         1.67     
18-21UT       3.00         2.00         1.67     
21-00UT       3.67         2.67         1.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is expected early on 07 Oct
with any glancing influence from the CME that left the Sun early on 04
Oct.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 07-Oct 09 2024

              Oct 07  Oct 08  Oct 09
S1 or greater   30%     25%     25%

Rationale: There is a chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton flux to
reach the S1 (Minor) threshold through 09 Sep due to the enhanced flare
potential from multiple regions near the western limb of the solar disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Oct 06 2024 2119 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 07-Oct 09 2024

              Oct 07        Oct 08        Oct 09
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   30%           25%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with
a chance for isolated R3 (Strong or greater) radio blackout events
through 09 Oct.
