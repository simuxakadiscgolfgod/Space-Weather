A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 03-Jan 05 2026 is 6.00 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 03-Jan 05 2026

             Jan 03       Jan 04       Jan 05
00-03UT       5.00 (G1)    3.67         3.00     
03-06UT       6.00 (G2)    3.33         2.00

12-15UT       4.00         3.00         2.67     
15-18UT       3.00         2.00         2.67     
18-21UT       3.00         4.67 (G1)    2.67     
21-00UT       4.33         3.67         3.00     

Rationale: G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storms are expected on 03
Jan and G1 storms on 04 Jan due to influence from both a negative
polarity CH HSS and multiple anticipated CMEs.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 03-Jan 05 2026

              Jan 03  Jan 04  Jan 05
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms over 03-05 Jan due to the eruptive potential of
multiple complex regions on the visible disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 03-Jan 05 2026

              Jan 03        Jan 04        Jan 05
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts,
with a slight chance for R3 (Strong), on 03-05 Jan due to the flare
potential of multiple complex regions on the visible disk.
