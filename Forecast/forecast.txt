A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 22-Oct 24 2024 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 22-Oct 24 2024

             Oct 22       Oct 23       Oct 24

18-21UT       2.67         2.33         2.00     
21-00UT       2.67         2.00         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 22-Oct 24 2024

              Oct 22  Oct 23  Oct 24
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 22-Oct 24 2024

              Oct 22        Oct 23        Oct 24
R1-R2           50%           60%           60%
R3 or greater    5%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be at low levels, with a chance
for moderate levels (R1-R2, Minor-Moderate) on 22 Oct. Moderate flare
levels are expected to increase to likely on 23-24 Oct, with a slight
chance for R3-Strong levels on 23-24 Oct. This flare level increase is
in anticipation of the return of old active Region 3842 (S15, L=180)
which produced M and X flares on its last transit.
