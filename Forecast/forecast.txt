A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 14-Dec 16 2023 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       2.33         3.67         3.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are likely on 15 and
16 Dec due to potential significant transient features.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 14-Dec 16 2023

              Dec 14  Dec 15  Dec 16
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 14-Dec 16 2023

              Dec 14        Dec 15        Dec 16
R1-R2           30%           35%           35%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There is a chance of an isolated R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) event
through 14 Dec. Chances of an event increase marginally on 15 Dec due to
the anticipated return of active regions from the previous rotation.
