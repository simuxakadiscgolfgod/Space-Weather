A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 16-Oct 18 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 16-Oct 18 2024

             Oct 16       Oct 17       Oct 18
00-03UT       4.67 (G1)    2.67         1.67     
03-06UT       3.67         2.33         1.33     
06-09UT       3.67         2.00         1.33     
09-12UT       3.33         2.00         1.33     
12-15UT       3.67         2.00         1.33     
15-18UT       4.00         2.00         1.33     
18-21UT       4.00         2.00         1.67     
21-00UT       3.67         2.33         1.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 16 Oct due to
possible CME influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 16-Oct 18 2024

              Oct 16  Oct 17  Oct 18
S1 or greater   15%      5%      5%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to remain at
background levels with a slight chance for a solar radiation storm event
through 16 Oct as ARs 3848 and 3849 transits the western limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Oct 15 2024 1833 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 16-Oct 18 2024

              Oct 16        Oct 17        Oct 18
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%            5%            5%

Rationale: Solar activity is likely to be moderate due to isolated
M-class flares (R1-R2, Minor-Moderate) on 16-18 Oct. There is a slight
chance for X-class flares (R3, Strong) through 16 Oct.
