A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 15-Jul 17 2024 is 1.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.33         1.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 15-Jul 17 2024

              Jul 15  Jul 16  Jul 17
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms will
persist through 17 Jul primarily due to the potential and increasingly
favorable location exhibited by AR 3738.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jul 14 2024 0234 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 15-Jul 17 2024

              Jul 15        Jul 16        Jul 17
R1-R2           65%           65%           65%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: A likely chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms will
persist through 17 Jul primarily due to the potential and increasingly
favorable location exhibited by AR 3738.
