A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 7 (NOAA Scale
G3).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 16-Sep 18 2025 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Sep 16-Sep 18 2025

             Sep 16       Sep 17       Sep 18
00-03UT       3.67         2.67         2.33     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    4.00         3.00     
06-09UT       4.00         4.00         3.00     
09-12UT       5.00 (G1)    3.33         2.33     
12-15UT       3.33         1.67         1.67     
15-18UT       3.00         1.67         1.67     
18-21UT       2.00         2.33         2.00     
21-00UT       3.00         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: Periods of G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming are expected
through midday on 16 Sep due to negative polarity CH HSS influences, in
addition to possible influence from the 11 Sep CME if it passes in close
proximity to Earth.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 16-Sep 18 2025

              Sep 16  Sep 17  Sep 18
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 16-Sep 18 2025

              Sep 16        Sep 17        Sep 18
R1-R2           30%           30%           30%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There is a chance for isolated R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts through 18 Sep.
