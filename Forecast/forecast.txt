A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 29-Mar 31 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 29-Mar 31 2025

             Mar 29       Mar 30       Mar 31
00-03UT       3.33         3.00         1.67

18-21UT       3.33         1.33         1.67     
21-00UT       3.33         2.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected. 

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 29-Mar 31 2025

              Mar 29  Mar 30  Mar 31
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 28 2025 1520 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 29-Mar 31 2025

              Mar 29        Mar 30        Mar 31
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   20%           20%           20%

Rationale: A chance for isolated R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate), and slight
chance for R3 (Strong), radio blackouts will persist through 31 Mar
primarily due to the potential exhibited by multiple regions near the E.
limb.
