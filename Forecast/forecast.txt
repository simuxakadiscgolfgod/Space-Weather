A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 05-Mar 07 2024 is 1.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 05-Mar 07 2024

              Mar 05  Mar 06  Mar 07
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 05-Mar 07 2024

              Mar 05        Mar 06        Mar 07
R1-R2           25%           15%           15%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: A chance for isolated R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
due to M-class flare activity will exist through 05 Mar primarily due to
the potential exhibited by AR 3595. Probabilities decrease to a slight
chance by 06 Mar and remain so through 07 Mar as AR 3595 rotates beyond
the western limb.
