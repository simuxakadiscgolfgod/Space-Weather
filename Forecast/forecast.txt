A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 10-Jul 12 2024 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jul 10-Jul 12 2024

             Jul 10       Jul 11       Jul 12
00-03UT       1.67         1.67         2.67

21-00UT       1.67         4.00         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 10-Jul 12 2024

              Jul 10  Jul 11  Jul 12
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jul 07 2024 2231 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 10-Jul 12 2024

              Jul 10        Jul 11        Jul 12
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for isolated R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
due to M-class flares will persist through 12 Jul primarily due to the
flare potential presented by AR 3738.
