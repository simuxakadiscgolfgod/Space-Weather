A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 27-Jan 29 2026 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 27-Jan 29 2026

             Jan 27       Jan 28       Jan 29

21-00UT       2.67         4.00         4.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 28 Jan due to CH
HSS influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 27-Jan 29 2026

              Jan 27  Jan 28  Jan 29
S1 or greater    5%      5%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 27-Jan 29 2026

              Jan 27        Jan 28        Jan 29
R1-R2           25%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            1%

Rationale: A chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to
isolated M-class flares will persist through 29 Jan.
