A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 15-Dec 17 2023 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 15-Dec 17 2023

             Dec 15       Dec 16       Dec 17
00-03UT       2.33         5.00 (G1)    1.67     
03-06UT       2.67         4.33         3.00     
06-09UT       2.67         3.00         2.67     
09-12UT       2.33         2.00         2.67     
12-15UT       2.33         2.33         4.67     
15-18UT       2.67         3.33         4.67     
18-21UT       3.67         4.00         3.00     
21-00UT       4.00         3.67         3.00     

Rationale: The geomagnetic field is likely to reach G1 (Minor)
geomagnetic storm conditions 15-17 Dec, due to combined effects of
positive polarity CH HSS influence and CME events that left the Sun on
late 11 Dec and 12 Dec. Trajectory and timing of CME influence from the
R3 event is currently undetermined.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 15-Dec 17 2023

              Dec 15  Dec 16  Dec 17
S1 or greater   35%     35%     10%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be at moderate levels
(R1-R2/Minor-Moderate), with an chance for an isolated R3 (Strong),
through 16 Dec, due to primarily to the flare potential from Region
3514.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 14 2023 1702 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 15-Dec 17 2023

              Dec 15        Dec 16        Dec 17
R1-R2           55%           55%           40%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           15%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
