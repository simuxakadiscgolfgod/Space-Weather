A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 02-Feb 04 2026 is 1.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 02-Feb 04 2026

              Feb 02  Feb 03  Feb 04
S1 or greater    65%     50%     10%

Rationale: Solar radiation storming is likely to exceed the S1 (Minor)
levels on 02 Feb with a chance on 03 Feb due to the recent X8.1 flare
from Region 4366 at 01/2357 UTC.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 01 2026 1233 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 02-Feb 04 2026

              Feb 02        Feb 03        Feb 04
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: R2 radio blackouts are expected.  Active region 4366 is
expected to produce more flare activity over the next three days, with a
chance for an R3 or greater event.
