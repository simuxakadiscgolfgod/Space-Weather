A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 01-Dec 03 2023 is 7.00 (NOAA Scale
G3).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 01-Dec 03 2023

             Dec 01       Dec 02       Dec 03
00-03UT       5.00 (G1)    5.00 (G1)    2.33     
03-06UT       6.00 (G2)    4.33         2.67     
06-09UT       7.00 (G3)    4.67 (G1)    2.00     
09-12UT       5.33 (G1)    2.33         2.00     
12-15UT       4.67 (G1)    2.67         2.67     
15-18UT       4.33         2.33         2.67     
18-21UT       3.33         3.00         2.67     
21-00UT       4.00         3.00         2.67     

Rationale: Geomagnetic storm levels are likely to begin early on 01 Dec,
with G1-G3 (Minor-Strong) levels anticipated due to CME arrival and
associated effects. Active to G1 conditions are likely on 02 Dec as CME
progression continues, but weakens.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 01-Dec 03 2023

              Dec 01  Dec 02  Dec 03
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to remain at
background, however, there is a slight chance of a S1 (Minor) event due
to the slight risk of a solar energetic proton event from Region 3500
all three days.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 01-Dec 03 2023

              Dec 01        Dec 02        Dec 03
R1-R2           35%           35%           35%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) and a slight
chance of an isolated R3 (Strong) radio blackouts on 01-03 Dec primarily
due to the flare probability of Region 3500.
