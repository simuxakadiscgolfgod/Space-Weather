A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Aug 04-Aug 06 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         2.33         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Aug 04-Aug 06 2025

              Aug 04  Aug 05  Aug 06
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Aug 03 2025 1357 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Aug 04-Aug 06 2025

              Aug 04        Aug 05        Aug 06
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There exists a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts over 04-06 Aug.
