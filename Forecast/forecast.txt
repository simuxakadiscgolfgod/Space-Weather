A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 1 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 17-Mar 19 2024 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.33         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 17-Mar 19 2024

              Mar 17  Mar 18  Mar 19
S1 or greater   40%      1%      1%

Rationale: There is a chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation storm levels
on 17 Mar.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 16 2024 1635 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 17-Mar 19 2024

              Mar 17        Mar 18        Mar 19
R1-R2            5%            5%            5%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
