A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 14-Jul 16 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jul 14-Jul 16 2024

             Jul 14       Jul 15       Jul 16
00-03UT       3.67         2.67         2.33     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    3.67         2.33

12-15UT       1.67         2.67         2.33     
15-18UT       1.67         2.67         2.00     
18-21UT       3.00         2.00         2.00     
21-00UT       2.67         2.00         2.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 14 Jul due to
positive polarity CH HSS effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 14-Jul 16 2024

              Jul 14  Jul 15  Jul 16
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms will
persist through 16 Jul primarily due to the potential and increasingly
favorable location exhibited by AR 3738.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jul 13 2024 1242 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 14-Jul 16 2024

              Jul 14        Jul 15        Jul 16
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: A likely chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms will
persist through 16 Jul primarily due to the potential and increasingly
favorable location exhibited by AR 3738.
