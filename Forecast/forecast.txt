A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 14-Dec 16 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 14-Dec 16 2024

             Dec 14       Dec 15       Dec 16
00-03UT       1.67         2.00         3.00

18-21UT       1.33         2.67         1.67     
21-00UT       1.33         3.00         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 14-Dec 16 2024

              Dec 14  Dec 15  Dec 16
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 13 2024 1124 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 14-Dec 16 2024

              Dec 14        Dec 15        Dec 16
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely through 16
Dec based primarily on the flare potential of Region 3917 and the growth
currently being exhibited by Region 3924.
