A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 02-May 04 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       3.67         2.67         3.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is expected on 02 May due to
CH HSS effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 02-May 04 2025

              May 02  May 03  May 04
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 02-May 04 2025

              May 02        May 03        May 04
R1-R2           50%           45%           45%
R3 or greater   10%           10%            5%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for
M-class flares (R1-R2, Minor-Moderate), and a slight chance for X-class
flares (R3-Strong), with those chances decreasing through 04 May.
