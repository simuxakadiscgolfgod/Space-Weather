A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 17-Nov 19 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 17-Nov 19 2024

             Nov 17       Nov 18       Nov 19

21-00UT       3.67         2.67         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 17-Nov 19 2024

              Nov 17  Nov 18  Nov 19
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton
flux to reach S1 (Minor) levels over 17-19 Nov.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Nov 16 2024 0137 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 17-Nov 19 2024

              Nov 17        Nov 18        Nov 19
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: A chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts will
persist through 19 Nov along with a slight chance for an R3 (Strong) or
great event.
