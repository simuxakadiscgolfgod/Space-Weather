A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 02-Mar 04 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       3.67         2.67         2.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 02-Mar 04 2024

              Mar 02  Mar 03  Mar 04
S1 or greater   15%      1%      1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storms on 02 Mar due to the flare potential of an active region near the
W limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 02-Mar 04 2024

              Mar 02        Mar 03        Mar 04
R1-R2           50%           25%           25%
R3 or greater   10%            1%            1%

Rationale: There exists a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts through 04 Mar and a slight chance for R3 (Strong) radio
blackouts on 02 Mar due to the flare potential of an active region near
the W limb.
