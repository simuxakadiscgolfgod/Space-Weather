A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 23-Nov 25 2023 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       3.00         2.33         4.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 23-Nov 25 2023

              Nov 23  Nov 24  Nov 25
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 23-Nov 25 2023

              Nov 23        Nov 24        Nov 25
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance for an R3 (Strong) event, throughout the forecast period
as Regions 3490 and 3492 continue to exhibit complex magnetic structure.
