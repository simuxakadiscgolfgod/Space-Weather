A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 31-Apr 02 2025 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.67         2.00         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 31-Apr 02 2025

              Mar 31  Apr 01  Apr 02
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 30 2025 1642 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 31-Apr 02 2025

              Mar 31        Apr 01        Apr 02
R1-R2           55%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely on 31 Mar,
with a chance for up to R2 events persists through 02 Apr. A slight
chance for R3 (Strong) events exists for 31 Mar - 02 Apr.
