A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 14-Sep 16 2024 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Sep 14-Sep 16 2024

             Sep 14       Sep 15       Sep 16
00-03UT       4.67 (G1)    3.00         3.33     
03-06UT       5.00 (G1)    2.33         3.33     
06-09UT       5.00 (G1)    2.33         4.67 (G1)
09-12UT       5.67 (G2)    3.33         4.33     
12-15UT       5.00 (G1)    3.33         3.67     
15-18UT       4.33         3.33         3.00     
18-21UT       4.00         3.00         3.00     
21-00UT       4.33         3.00         3.00     

Rationale: G1-2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storming is likely on 14
Sep due to ongoing and additional anticipated CME activity. Additional
G1 (Minor) activity is likely on 16 Sep due to additional CME activity.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 14-Sep 16 2024

              Sep 14  Sep 15  Sep 16
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation event will
persist through 16 Sep as multiple regions transit the western limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Sep 13 2024 0656 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 14-Sep 16 2024

              Sep 14        Sep 15        Sep 16
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely on 14-16
Sep. R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts event probabilities remain
likely through the period as multiple regions exist on the disk.
