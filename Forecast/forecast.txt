A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 06-Feb 08 2026 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       3.67         4.00         3.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 06 and 08 Feb due
to the anticipated arrival of two CMEs glancing impacts near Earth.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 06-Feb 08 2026

              Feb 06  Feb 07  Feb 08
S1 or greater   25%     25%     25%

Rationale: There is a chance for a S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms on
06-08 Feb due to the magnetic complexity and dynamic of the active
regions on the visible disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 05 2026 0436 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 06-Feb 08 2026

              Feb 06        Feb 07        Feb 08
R1-R2           80%           80%           80%
R3 or greater   35%           35%           35%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
chance for R3 (Strong) or greater levels on 06-08 Feb due to the
magnetic complexity and dynamic of the active regions on the visible
disk.
