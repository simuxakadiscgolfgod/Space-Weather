A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 17-Sep 19 2024 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Sep 17-Sep 19 2024

             Sep 17       Sep 18       Sep 19
00-03UT       5.67 (G2)    2.67         2.33     
03-06UT       5.00 (G1)    2.33         3.00     
06-09UT       4.67 (G1)    2.33         2.33     
09-12UT       4.00         2.33         2.00     
12-15UT       2.67         2.33         1.67     
15-18UT       2.33         2.00         1.33     
18-21UT       2.33         2.33         1.33     
21-00UT       3.00         2.67         2.00     

Rationale: G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storming is likely on 17
Sep due to potential combined CH HSS and CME influences from separate
events. Background conditions are expected on 18-19 Sep.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 17-Sep 19 2024

              Sep 17  Sep 18  Sep 19
S1 or greater   20%     15%     10%

Rationale: A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation event will
persist through 19 Sep as multiple active regions exist on the disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 17-Sep 19 2024

              Sep 17        Sep 18        Sep 19
R1-R2           55%           45%           40%
R3 or greater   15%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is likely to reach moderate (R1-R2,
Minor-Moderate), with a slight chance for X-class flares (R3-Strong), on
17 Sep. Probabilities are decreasing to a chance for M-class flares on
18-19 Sep as Regions 3814 and 3822 rotate around the NW limb.
