A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 18-May 20 2024 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

             May 18       May 19       May 20

21-00UT       2.33         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: G2 (Moderate) geomagnetic storms are expected on 18 May due
to CME effects. No significant transient or recurrent solar wind
features are forecast for 19-20 May.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 18-May 20 2024

              May 18  May 19  May 20
S1 or greater   10%      5%      5%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1-S2 (Minor-Moderate) conditions exists
on 18 May due to the flare potential from now departed Region 3664.
Probabilities drop to a nominal levels on 19-20 May from the remaining
active regions on the Suns visible disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 17 2024 2108 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 18-May 20 2024

              May 18        May 19        May 20
R1-R2           55%           35%           35%
R3 or greater   25%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) conditions are likely on 18 May and a
chance for R3 (Strong) exist 18 May. Conditions decay to a chance for
R1-R2 conditions and a slight chance for R3 on 19-20 May.
