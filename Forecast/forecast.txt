A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 1 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 11-Dec 13 2023 is 3.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 11-Dec 13 2023

             Dec 11       Dec 12       Dec 13

18-21UT       2.33         2.33         1.67     
21-00UT       3.00         3.00         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 11-Dec 13 2023

              Dec 11  Dec 12  Dec 13
S1 or greater   10%     10%      5%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storms over 11-12 Dec due to the flare potential of Regions 3511 and
3513.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 10 2023 0353 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 11-Dec 13 2023

              Dec 11        Dec 12        Dec 13
R1-R2           55%           55%           40%
R3 or greater   10%           10%            5%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance for R3 or greater events, on 11-12 Dec due to the flare
potential of Regions 3511 and 3513. There is a chance for R1-R2 events
on 13 Dec as Region 3511 transits the W limb.
