A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 21-Nov 23 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         3.00         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 21-Nov 23 2024

              Nov 21  Nov 22  Nov 23
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Nov 20 2024 1948 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 21-Nov 23 2024

              Nov 21        Nov 22        Nov 23
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low, with a chance for
M-class flares (R1/R2-Minor/Moderate) and a slight chance of X-class
(R3-Strong) events 21-23 Nov.
