A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 21-Sep 23 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Sep 21-Sep 23 2025

             Sep 21       Sep 22       Sep 23
00-03UT       3.33         4.00         2.67

15-18UT       3.33         3.33         2.67     
18-21UT       3.67         3.00         2.67     
21-00UT       3.67         3.00         2.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 22 Sep due to
negative polarity CH HSS effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 21-Sep 23 2025

              Sep 21  Sep 22  Sep 23
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 21-Sep 23 2025

              Sep 21        Sep 22        Sep 23
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts will
persist through 23 Sep while increasing somewhat due to returning
regions.
