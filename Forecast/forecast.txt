A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 25-Jan 27 2024 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 25-Jan 27 2024

             Jan 25       Jan 26       Jan 27
00-03UT       3.00         4.00         4.00     
03-06UT       2.67         4.00         4.33     
06-09UT       3.00         2.33         4.00     
09-12UT       3.33         2.00         4.00     
12-15UT       4.67 (G1)    2.67         4.00     
15-18UT       3.67         4.00         4.33     
18-21UT       3.00         5.00 (G1)    4.67 (G1)
21-00UT       3.67         4.67 (G1)    4.33     

Rationale: Periods of G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely, with a
chance of isolated G2 (Moderate) storm periods on 25-27 Jan due to the
possible impacts of several nearby passing CMEs from several events on
22-23 Jan.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 25-Jan 27 2024

              Jan 25  Jan 26  Jan 27
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton
flux to reach S1 (Minor) threshold through 27 Jan - primarily due to the
potential and favorable location of AR 3561.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 24 2024 0140 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 25-Jan 27 2024

              Jan 25        Jan 26        Jan 27
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely through 26
Jan - primarily due to the flare potential of ARs 3559 and 3561.
Additionally, there is a slight chance for R3 (Strong) or greater radio
blackouts.
