A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 14-Jul 16 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected. 

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 14-Jul 16 2025

              Jul 14  Jul 15  Jul 16
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 14-Jul 16 2025

              Jul 14        Jul 15        Jul 16
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There exists a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts over 14-16 Jul due to potential from multiple sunspots on the
visible disk.
