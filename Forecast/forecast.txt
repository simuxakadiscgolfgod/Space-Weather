A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 20-Sep 22 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Sep 20-Sep 22 2025

             Sep 20       Sep 21       Sep 22
00-03UT       1.67         1.67         4.00

21-00UT       1.67         4.33         3.00     

Rationale: Mostly quiet conditions are expected through most of 21 Sep.
Unsettled to active conditions, with isolated minor storm (G1-minor)
levels, are expected by late on 21 Sep/early on 22 Sep due to CH HSS
onset.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 20-Sep 22 2025

              Sep 20  Sep 21  Sep 22
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Sep 19 2025 2141 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 20-Sep 22 2025

              Sep 20        Sep 21        Sep 22
R1-R2           35%           35%           35%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There remains a chance for isolated R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate)
radio blackouts through 22 Sep.
