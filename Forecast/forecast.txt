A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 27-Sep 29 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 27-Sep 29 2024

              Sep 27  Sep 28  Sep 29
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Sep 26 2024 2312 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 27-Sep 29 2024

              Sep 27        Sep 28        Sep 29
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: M-class (R1-R2, Minor-Moderate) flares are likely and there
is a slight chance for X-class (R3- Strong) flares on 27-29 Sep.
