A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 20-May 22 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown May 20-May 22 2025

             May 20       May 21       May 22

18-21UT       2.00         2.67         2.33     
21-00UT       2.67         2.67         2.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.
Active periods possible on 20-21 May due to persistent CH HSS influence.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 20-May 22 2025

              May 20  May 21  May 22
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 19 2025 0821 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 20-May 22 2025

              May 20        May 21        May 22
R1-R2           35%           35%           35%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low, with a 35% chance for
R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) events, over 20-22 May. Probabilities increased
slightly based on the flare potential of the active region near the NE
limb.
