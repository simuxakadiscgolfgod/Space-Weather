A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 28-Mar 30 2024 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.33         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 28-Mar 30 2024

              Mar 28  Mar 29  Mar 30
S1 or greater   30%     30%     10%

Rationale: There is a chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation
storms over the next three days due to the flare potential for Region
3615.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 27 2024 0641 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 28-Mar 30 2024

              Mar 28        Mar 29        Mar 30
R1-R2           75%           75%           40%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           10%

Rationale: Due to the flare potential of Region 3615, R1-R2
(Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a chance for R3
(Strong), over the next three days.
