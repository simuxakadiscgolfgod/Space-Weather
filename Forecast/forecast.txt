A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 04-Dec 06 2023 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 04-Dec 06 2023

             Dec 04       Dec 05       Dec 06
00-03UT       2.67         4.67 (G1)    3.00

09-12UT       5.67 (G2)    3.00         2.33     
12-15UT       4.67 (G1)    2.33         2.00     
15-18UT       4.00         2.00         2.00     
18-21UT       3.33         3.00         2.33     
21-00UT       4.67 (G1)    3.33         3.00     

Rationale: G2 (Moderate) geomagnetic storms are likely on 04 Dec due to
negative polarity CH HSS influences. G1 (Minor) levels are likely on 05
Dec due to continued CH HSS influences in addition to the glancing-blow
arrival of a CME from 01 Dec.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 04-Dec 06 2023

              Dec 04  Dec 05  Dec 06
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 04-Dec 06 2023

              Dec 04        Dec 05        Dec 06
R1-R2           30%           30%           25%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
over 04-06 Dec.
