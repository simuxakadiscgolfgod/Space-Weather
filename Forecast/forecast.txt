A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 22-Feb 24 2024 is 1.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 22-Feb 24 2024

              Feb 22  Feb 23  Feb 24
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 21 2024 2307 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 22-Feb 24 2024

              Feb 22        Feb 23        Feb 24
R1-R2           30%           35%           40%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: An increasing chance of R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
takes place through 24 Feb due to the anticipated return of old AR 3575.
A slight chance for R3 (Strong) radio blackouts will persist through 24
Feb due to the recent activity from AR 3590 combined with the return of
old AR 3575.
