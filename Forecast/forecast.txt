A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 12-Sep 14 2025 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       3.00         1.67         4.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 12-Sep 14 2025

              Sep 12  Sep 13  Sep 14
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 12-Sep 14 2025

              Sep 12        Sep 13        Sep 14
R1-R2           30%           30%           30%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: A chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts will
persist through 14 Sep primarily due to the flare potential of Regions
4213 and 4216.
