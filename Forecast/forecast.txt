A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 30-Apr 01 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 30-Apr 01 2024

             Mar 30       Mar 31       Apr 01
00-03UT       3.00         2.00         2.67

12-15UT       1.00         3.00         2.33     
15-18UT       1.00         3.00         2.33     
18-21UT       2.00         2.00         2.33     
21-00UT       2.00         2.00         2.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 30-Apr 01 2024

              Mar 30  Mar 31  Apr 01
S1 or greater   15%     10%      5%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms on 30-31 Mar due to the flare potential for Region
3615.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 29 2024 0230 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 30-Apr 01 2024

              Mar 30        Mar 31        Apr 01
R1-R2           75%           75%            5%
R3 or greater   25%           25%            1%

Rationale: Due to the flare potential of Region 3615, R1-R2
(Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a chance for R3
(Strong), over the next two days. Probabilities decrease for 01 Apr as
Region 3615 rotates beyond the western limb.
