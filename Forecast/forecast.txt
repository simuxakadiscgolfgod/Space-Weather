A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 27-Mar 29 2025 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 27-Mar 29 2025

             Mar 27       Mar 28       Mar 29
00-03UT       5.67 (G2)    3.67         3.33     
03-06UT       5.33 (G1)    4.00         2.00     
06-09UT       4.33         4.00         2.00     
09-12UT       4.33         3.67         3.00     
12-15UT       4.00         3.67         3.00     
15-18UT       4.00         3.67         3.33     
18-21UT       3.67         4.00         3.33     
21-00UT       4.00         4.00         3.33     

Rationale: The geomagnetic field should continue to see periods of G1-G2
(Minor-Moderate) storming levels into 27 Mar due to the CH HSS.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 27-Mar 29 2025

              Mar 27  Mar 28  Mar 29
S1 or greater    5%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 26 2025 0809 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 27-Mar 29 2025

              Mar 27        Mar 28        Mar 29
R1-R2           30%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    5%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for isolated R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackout activity through 27 Mar, with chances decreasing as Region 4036
continues to move beyond the western limb. Chances for R3 (Strong)
events remain very low through 29 Mar.
