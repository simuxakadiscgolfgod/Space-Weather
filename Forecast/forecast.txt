A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 25-Oct 27 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 25-Oct 27 2024

             Oct 25       Oct 26       Oct 27
00-03UT       3.67         4.00         2.00     
03-06UT       4.33         4.67 (G1)    2.00     
06-09UT       3.00         3.67         1.67     
09-12UT       2.67         3.00         1.67     
12-15UT       2.33         3.00         1.33     
15-18UT       2.00         2.67         2.00     
18-21UT       2.67         2.00         2.00     
21-00UT       2.67         2.33         2.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are likely on 26 Oct
due to the anticipated arrival of a CME that left the Sun on 24 Oct.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 25-Oct 27 2024

              Oct 25  Oct 26  Oct 27
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storms over 25-27 Oct due to the flare potential of several regions in
the SE quadrant of the visible disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Oct 24 2024 0357 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 25-Oct 27 2024

              Oct 25        Oct 26        Oct 27
R1-R2           70%           70%           70%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts, with a slight chance
for R3 (Strong), are likely over 25-27 Oct. This is primarily driven by
a group of complex active regions in the SE quadrant of the visible
disk.
