A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 16-Jan 18 2026 is 5.33 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 16-Jan 18 2026

             Jan 16       Jan 17       Jan 18

09-12UT       2.33         4.67 (G1)    3.33     
12-15UT       2.00         3.33         3.67     
15-18UT       2.00         2.33         3.33     
18-21UT       2.33         3.00         4.67 (G1)
21-00UT       3.00         4.00         3.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are possible on 17
and 18 Jan due to the anticipated arrival of coronal hole high speed
stream and a co-rotating interaction region (CIR) ahead of it.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 16-Jan 18 2026

              Jan 16  Jan 17  Jan 18
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 16-Jan 18 2026

              Jan 16        Jan 17        Jan 18
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There is a likely chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts on 16-18 Jan.
