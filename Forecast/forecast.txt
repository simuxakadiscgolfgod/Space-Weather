A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 16-May 18 2024 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.33         4.33         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 16-May 18 2024

              May 16  May 17  May 18
S1 or greater   99%     15%     10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) conditions are expected on 16 May due
to the flare potential from now departed Region 3664. Probabilities drop
to a slight chance on 17-18 May from the remaining active regions on the
Suns visible disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 15 2024 0837 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 16-May 18 2024

              May 16        May 17        May 18
R1-R2           75%           40%           40%
R3 or greater   40%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) conditions are expected on 16 May due
to the flare potential from now departed Region 3664. Probabilities drop
to a chance on 17-18 May from the remaining active regions on the Suns
visible disk.
