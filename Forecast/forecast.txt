A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 13-Jul 15 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

18-21UT       4.33         3.00         2.00     
21-00UT       4.67 (G1)    3.00         2.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 13 and 14 Jul
due to positive polarity CH HSS effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 13-Jul 15 2024

              Jul 13  Jul 14  Jul 15
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms will
persist through 15 Jul primarily due to the potential and increasingly
favorable location exhibited by AR 3738.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jul 07 2024 2231 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 13-Jul 15 2024

              Jul 13        Jul 14        Jul 15
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms will
persist through 15 Jul primarily due to the potential and increasingly
favorable location exhibited by AR 3738.
