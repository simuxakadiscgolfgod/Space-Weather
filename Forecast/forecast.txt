A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 12-Dec 14 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 12-Dec 14 2025

             Dec 12       Dec 13       Dec 14
00-03UT       4.00         4.33         3.67     
03-06UT       4.67 (G1)    3.67         3.00

12-15UT       3.33         2.00         2.67     
15-18UT       3.00         2.67         2.00     
18-21UT       3.33         3.33         2.00     
21-00UT       3.67         3.67         2.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) storming is likely early on 12 Dec as weak
enhancements in the solar wind environment persist.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 12-Dec 14 2025

              Dec 12  Dec 13  Dec 14
S1 or greater   10%      5%      1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for an S1 (Minor) radiation storming
event on 12 Dec as the complex regions in the western hemisphere move
beyond the limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 12-Dec 14 2025

              Dec 12        Dec 13        Dec 14
R1-R2           65%           60%           55%
R3 or greater   10%            5%            5%

Rationale: Chances for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts decrease
over 12-14 Dec as major flare producing regions move beyond the west
limb.
