A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Aug 22-Aug 24 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Aug 22-Aug 24 2024

             Aug 22       Aug 23       Aug 24
00-03UT       3.33         2.33         1.67     
03-06UT       3.67         2.67         1.33

09-12UT       2.67         2.00         1.33     
12-15UT       2.67         2.33         1.33     
15-18UT       2.00         2.00         1.33     
18-21UT       2.00         2.00         1.67     
21-00UT       1.67         2.00         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Aug 22-Aug 24 2024

              Aug 22  Aug 23  Aug 24
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: A slight chance for a S1 (Minor) solar radiation event will
persist through 24 Aug primarily due to the potential presented by
AR3790 and AR3796.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Aug 21 2024 2208 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Aug 22-Aug 24 2024

              Aug 22        Aug 23        Aug 24
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   20%           20%           20%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to M-class flare
activity are likely through 24 Aug, along with a slight chance for R3
(Strong) events, primarily given the potential exhibited by ARs 3790
and 3796.
