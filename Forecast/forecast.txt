A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 22-May 24 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         1.33         3.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 22-May 24 2024

              May 22  May 23  May 24
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance of an S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storm due to the slight risk of solar energetic particle events from
mainly Regions 3683, 3679, and 3685.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 21 2024 1931 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 22-May 24 2024

              May 22        May 23        May 24
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is likely to be moderate with M-class flare
activity (R1-R2; Minor-Moderate) probable and a slight chance of X-class
flares (R3; Strong) 22-24 May due primarily to the combined flare
probabilities of Regions 3683, 3679, and 3685.
