A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 31-Jan 02 2025 is 6.67 (NOAA Scale
G3).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Dec 31-Jan 02 2025

             Dec 31       Jan 01       Jan 02
00-03UT       1.67         5.00 (G1)    2.67     
03-06UT       3.67         3.33         2.00     
06-09UT       4.33         4.33         2.00     
09-12UT       5.00 (G1)    3.67         2.00     
12-15UT       6.00 (G2)    2.67         2.00     
15-18UT       6.67 (G3)    2.33         2.00     
18-21UT       5.33 (G1)    2.00         2.00     
21-00UT       5.00 (G1)    3.00         2.33     

Rationale: Isolated periods of G3 (Strong) geomagnetic storming are
likely by mid UTC day on 31 Dec due to CME effects from a partial-halo
event from 29 Dec. Lingering G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely,
with a chance for G2 (Moderate) levels, on 01 Jan with the likely
arrival of the second CME, also from 29 Dec.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 31-Jan 02 2025

              Dec 31  Jan 01  Jan 02
S1 or greater   20%     20%     15%

Rationale:  A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation storm
event will persist through 02 Jan given the current total disk
potential.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 30 2024 0414 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 31-Jan 02 2025

              Dec 31        Jan 01        Jan 02
R1-R2           80%           80%           80%
R3 or greater   30%           30%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
chance for an isolated R3 (Strong) event, through 02 Jan.
