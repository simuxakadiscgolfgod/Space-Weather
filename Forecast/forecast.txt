A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jul 25-Jul 27 2025 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jul 25-Jul 27 2025

             Jul 25       Jul 26       Jul 27

21-00UT       2.67         1.67         3.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm levels are likely on 27 Jul due
to potential CME activity.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jul 25-Jul 27 2025

              Jul 25  Jul 26  Jul 27
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jul 25-Jul 27 2025

              Jul 25        Jul 26        Jul 27
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for
M-class flares (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) through 27 July.
