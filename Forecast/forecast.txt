A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 7 (NOAA Scale
G3).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Apr 20-Apr 22 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.67         2.00         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected. 

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Apr 20-Apr 22 2024

              Apr 20  Apr 21  Apr 22
S1 or greater   20%     20%     20%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation storm
conditions over 20-22 Apr due to the flare potential of several active
regions on the visible disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Apr 19 2024 0453 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Apr 20-Apr 22 2024

              Apr 20        Apr 21        Apr 22
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   20%           20%           20%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) events are expected, with a slight
chance for R3 (Strong) or greater events, over 20-22 Apr due to the
flare potential of several active regions on the visible disk.
