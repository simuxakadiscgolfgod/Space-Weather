A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 11-Feb 13 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 11-Feb 13 2025

             Feb 11       Feb 12       Feb 13
00-03UT       4.00         3.33         3.67     
03-06UT       3.33         3.00         3.33

12-15UT       2.67         3.00         3.33     
15-18UT       3.00         3.00         3.33     
18-21UT       3.33         3.33         3.67     
21-00UT       3.67         4.00         4.67 (G1)

Rationale: G1 (Minor) storm periods are likely on 13 Feb due to onset of
a subsequent negative polarity CH HSS.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 11-Feb 13 2025

              Feb 11  Feb 12  Feb 13
S1 or greater   10%      5%      5%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storms on 11 Feb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 10 2025 0046 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 11-Feb 13 2025

              Feb 11        Feb 12        Feb 13
R1-R2           55%           40%           30%
R3 or greater   10%            5%            5%

Rationale: Solar activity will likely reach moderate levels (R1-R2,
Minor-Moderate), with a slight chance for isolated X-Class (R3-Strong)
events, through 11 Feb due to the cluster of sunspot groups in the NW
quadrant. Activity will likely decrease further on 12-13 Feb to only a
isolated chance for R1-R2 events as AR 3981 rotates beyond the western
limb.
