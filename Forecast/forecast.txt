A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 03-Nov 05 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

18-21UT       3.67         1.67         1.00     
21-00UT       3.67         2.67         1.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 03-Nov 05 2024

              Nov 03  Nov 04  Nov 05
S1 or greater   30%     30%      5%

Rationale: There is a chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton flux to
remain elevated but below the threshold over 03-04 Nov.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Nov 02 2024 0831 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 03-Nov 05 2024

              Nov 03        Nov 04        Nov 05
R1-R2           75%           75%           50%
R3 or greater   35%           35%           10%

Rationale: M-class (R1-minor) are expected, with a chance for X-class
(R3-strong), through 04 Nov. On 05 Nov, there is a chance for M-class
(R1-minor) activity and a slight chance for X-class (R3-strong)
activity.
