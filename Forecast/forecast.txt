A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 24-Nov 26 2025 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 24-Nov 26 2025

             Nov 24       Nov 25       Nov 26

21-00UT       1.67         5.00 (G1)    3.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 26 Nov due to CH
HSS influence.  No significant transient or recurrent solar wind
features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 24-Nov 26 2025

              Nov 24  Nov 25  Nov 26
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 24-Nov 26 2025

              Nov 24        Nov 25        Nov 26
R1-R2           15%           15%           15%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There exists a slight chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts over 24-26 Nov.
