A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 17-Jan 19 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 17-Jan 19 2024

             Jan 17       Jan 18       Jan 19
00-03UT       2.67         2.33         1.67

21-00UT       2.67         2.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 17-Jan 19 2024

              Jan 17  Jan 18  Jan 19
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 17-Jan 19 2024

              Jan 17        Jan 18        Jan 19
R1-R2           25%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for isolated radio blackouts (R1-2/Minor-Moderate)
due to M-class flare activity will persist through 19 Jan.
