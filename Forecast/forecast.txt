A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Apr 11-Apr 13 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       3.67         2.33         3.00     

Rationale: An isolated early period of a G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm is
expected on 11 Apr in response to waning, but continuing CH HSS
influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Apr 11-Apr 13 2025

              Apr 11  Apr 12  Apr 13
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Apr 11-Apr 13 2025

              Apr 11        Apr 12        Apr 13
R1-R2           45%           45%           45%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
