A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 22-Jan 24 2024 is 6.00 (NOAA Scale
G2).

             Jan 22       Jan 23       Jan 24

15-18UT       3.67         5.00 (G1)    2.00     
18-21UT       6.00 (G2)    3.00         1.00     
21-00UT       5.00 (G1)    1.67         2.00     

Rationale: G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storms are likely on 22-23
Jan due to anticipated influence from CMEs that left the Sun on 20 Jan.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 22-Jan 24 2024

              Jan 22  Jan 23  Jan 24
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 22-Jan 24 2024

              Jan 22        Jan 23        Jan 24
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts,
and a slight chance for R3 (Strong) radio blackouts, over the next three
days due primarily to the flare potential of Region 3559.
