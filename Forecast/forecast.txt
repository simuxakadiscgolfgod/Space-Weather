A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Aug 31-Sep 02 2025 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Aug 31-Sep 02 2025

21-00UT       2.67         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Aug 31-Sep 02 2025

              Aug 31  Sep 01  Sep 02
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton
flux to reach S1 (Minor) storm levels through 02 Sep.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Aug 30 2025 2002 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Aug 31-Sep 02 2025

              Aug 31        Sep 01        Sep 02
R1-R2           65%           65%           65%
R3 or greater   20%           20%           20%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance for an isolated R3 (Strong or greater) event through 02
Sep.
