A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 15-Feb 17 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 15-Feb 17 2024

             Feb 15       Feb 16       Feb 17

18-21UT       2.00         1.67         1.67     
21-00UT       2.33         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 15-Feb 17 2024

              Feb 15  Feb 16  Feb 17
S1 or greater   75%     15%      5%

Rationale:  S1 (Minor) solar radiation storm levels are expected for the
early part of 15 Feb. Probabilities for a solar radiation storm decrease
to just a slight chance for 16 Feb, yet remain relevant given AR 3576s
physical location and event history. 

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 14 2024 0310 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 15-Feb 17 2024

              Feb 15        Feb 16        Feb 17
R1-R2           55%           55%           35%
R3 or greater   15%           15%            5%

Rationale: R1-2/Minor-Moderate radio blackouts are likely, with a slight
chance for an isolated R3/Strong radio blackout event, through 16 Feb.
Radio blackouts are less likely on 17 Feb as AR 3576 rotates off the
disk.
