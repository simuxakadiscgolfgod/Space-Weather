A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 23-May 25 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown May 23-May 25 2024

             May 23       May 24       May 25
00-03UT       1.67         2.67         3.33

15-18UT       1.33         2.67         1.67     
18-21UT       1.67         2.67         1.67     
21-00UT       1.33         3.00         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 23-May 25 2024

              May 23  May 24  May 25
S1 or greater   15%     15%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance of an S1 (Minor) solar radiation
storm due to the slight risk of solar energetic particle events from
mainly Regions 3679 and 3685.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at May 22 2024 0404 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 23-May 25 2024

              May 23        May 24        May 25
R1-R2           60%           60%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: Solar activity is likely to remain moderate (R1-R2;
Minor-Moderate) 23-25 May, with a slight chance of X-class flares (R3;
Strong) due primarily to the increasing flare potential of Region 3679
and continued flare probability of Region 3685.
