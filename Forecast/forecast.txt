A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 04-Feb 06 2025 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       3.67         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 04-Feb 06 2025

              Feb 04  Feb 05  Feb 06
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: There exists a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms over 04-06 Feb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 03 2025 0358 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 04-Feb 06 2025

              Feb 04        Feb 05        Feb 06
R1-R2           85%           85%           85%
R3 or greater   20%           20%           20%

Rationale: R1-R2(Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
slight chance for isolated R3 (Strong) events, over 04-06 Feb,
primarily due to potential from an active region cluster in the Suns
northern hemisphere.
