A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jun 25-Jun 27 2024 is 2.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.67         1.67         1.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jun 25-Jun 27 2024

              Jun 25  Jun 26  Jun 27
S1 or greater   10%      5%      1%

Rationale: A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation event will
persist through 25 Jun due to recent activity from the western limb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jun 24 2024 0452 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jun 25-Jun 27 2024

              Jun 25        Jun 26        Jun 27
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to M-class flare
activity will remain likely through 27 June along with a slight chance
for an isolated R3 (Strong) event.
