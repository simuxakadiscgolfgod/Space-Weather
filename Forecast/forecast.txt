A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4.67 (NOAA
Scale G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 18-Dec 20 2025 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       3.00         2.67         2.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are expected on 18 Dec due to
persistent CH HSS influence.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 18-Dec 20 2025

              Dec 18  Dec 19  Dec 20
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 18-Dec 20 2025

              Dec 18        Dec 19        Dec 20
R1-R2           15%           15%           15%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
