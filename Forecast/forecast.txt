A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jun 13-Jun 15 2025 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

             Jun 13       Jun 14       Jun 15
00-03UT       5.33 (G1)    3.33         3.67

18-21UT       2.67         4.67 (G1)    3.67     
21-00UT       2.33         5.67 (G2)    3.67     

Rationale: G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) or greater geomagnetic storms are
expected early on 13 Jun due to what is likely passage of the 08 Jun
transient. G1-G2 storms are likely on 14-15 Jun due to the expected
onset of a CIR and subsequent CH HSS.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jun 13-Jun 15 2025

              Jun 13  Jun 14  Jun 15
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jun 13-Jun 15 2025

              Jun 13        Jun 14        Jun 15
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
all three days.
