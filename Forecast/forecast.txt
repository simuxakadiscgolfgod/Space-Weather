A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 29-Dec 01 2023 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 29-Dec 01 2023

             Nov 29       Nov 30       Dec 01
00-03UT       1.67         5.00 (G1)    5.00 (G1)
03-06UT       2.00         5.33 (G1)    5.67 (G2)
06-09UT       1.33         4.67 (G1)    5.00 (G1)
09-12UT       1.33         4.00         4.33     
12-15UT       2.00         3.33         4.00     
15-18UT       2.33         3.00         3.00     
18-21UT       2.67         3.33         3.33     
21-00UT       4.00         3.67         3.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely, with a chance for
an isolated G2 (Moderate) period, on 30 Nov as the 27 Nov CME effects
continue. By 01 Dec, G2 (Moderate) conditions are likely with the
anticipated arrival of the late 27 Nov/early 28 Nov CMEs.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 29-Dec 01 2023

              Nov 29  Nov 30  Dec 01
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux may experience a slight
enhancement on 29 Nov due to the event produced by AR 3500 on the 28
Nov. Otherwise, background levels are expected to persist through 01
Dec.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Nov 28 2023 1950 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 29-Dec 01 2023

              Nov 29        Nov 30        Dec 01
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There is a chance for isolated R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) and a
slight chance for Strong (R3) radio blackouts through 01 Dec primarily
due to AR 3500.
