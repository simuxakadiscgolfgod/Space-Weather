A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 24-Jan 26 2024 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 24-Jan 26 2024

             Jan 24       Jan 25       Jan 26
00-03UT       1.67         3.00         4.00     
03-06UT       2.00         2.67         4.00     
06-09UT       3.00         3.00         2.33     
09-12UT       4.67 (G1)    3.33         2.00     
12-15UT       4.00         4.67 (G1)    2.67     
15-18UT       3.33         3.67         4.00     
18-21UT       3.00         3.00         5.00 (G1)
21-00UT       3.00         3.67         4.67 (G1)

Rationale: Periods of G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely, with a
chance of isolated G2 (Moderate) storm periods on 24-26 Jan due to the
possible impacts of several nearby passing CMEs.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 24-Jan 26 2024

              Jan 24  Jan 25  Jan 26
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: Theres a slight chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton
flux to reach S1 (Minor) threshold through 26 Jan, mostly due to the
potential and favorable location of AR 3561.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 23 2024 0331 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 24-Jan 26 2024

              Jan 24        Jan 25        Jan 26
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected through
26 Jan, along with a slight chance for R3 (Strong) or greater radio
blackouts, due primarily to the flare potential of ARs 3559 and 3561.
