A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 12-Jan 14 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 12-Jan 14 2024

             Jan 12       Jan 13       Jan 14
00-03UT       1.67         2.33         2.00

21-00UT       2.00         3.00         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 12-Jan 14 2024

              Jan 12  Jan 13  Jan 14
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 11 2024 1752 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 12-Jan 14 2024

              Jan 12        Jan 13        Jan 14
R1-R2           45%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due
isolated M-class flare activity will persist through the forecast
period.
