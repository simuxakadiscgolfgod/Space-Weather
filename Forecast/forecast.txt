A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 1 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 10-Dec 12 2023 is 3.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.33         3.00         3.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 10-Dec 12 2023

              Dec 10  Dec 11  Dec 12
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms all three days.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Dec 09 2023 0955 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 10-Dec 12 2023

              Dec 10        Dec 11        Dec 12
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) or greater radio blackouts are likely,
and there is a slight chance for R3 (Strong) or greater blackouts all
three days.
