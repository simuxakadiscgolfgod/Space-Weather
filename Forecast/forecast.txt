A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Aug 21-Aug 23 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Aug 21-Aug 23 2024

             Aug 21       Aug 22       Aug 23
00-03UT       1.67         3.33         2.33

09-12UT       1.33         2.67         2.00     
12-15UT       0.67         2.67         2.33     
15-18UT       1.33         2.00         2.00     
18-21UT       1.67         2.00         2.00     
21-00UT       1.67         1.67         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Aug 21-Aug 23 2024

              Aug 21  Aug 22  Aug 23
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: A slight chance for an S1 (Minor) solar radiation event will
persist through 23 Aug primarily given the development observed in
AR3790.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Aug 20 2024 1708 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Aug 21-Aug 23 2024

              Aug 21        Aug 22        Aug 23
R1-R2           65%           65%           65%
R3 or greater   20%           20%           20%

Rationale: R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to M-class flare
activity are likely through 23 Aug, along with a slight chance for R3
(Strong) events, primarily given the potential exhibited by ARs 3790
and 3795.
