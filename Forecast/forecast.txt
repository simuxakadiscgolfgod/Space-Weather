A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 30-Feb 01 2024 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 30-Feb 01 2024

             Jan 30       Jan 31       Feb 01
00-03UT       3.00         2.67         2.33

21-00UT       4.00         1.67         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 30-Feb 01 2024

              Jan 30  Jan 31  Feb 01
S1 or greater   99%     60%     10%

Rationale: An S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storm is in
progress and is expected to continue through 30 Jan. A chance for S1 or
greater solar radiation storms remains for 31 Jan, decreasing to a
slight chance by 01 Feb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 29 2024 0438 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 30-Feb 01 2024

              Jan 30        Jan 31        Feb 01
R1-R2           40%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: A decreasing chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts is expected through 01 Feb as Region 3559 rotates around the
NW limb.
