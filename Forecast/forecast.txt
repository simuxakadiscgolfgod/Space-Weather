A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 15-Mar 17 2025 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       3.67         3.33         3.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 15-Mar 17 2025

              Mar 15  Mar 16  Mar 17
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 14 2025 2221 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 15-Mar 17 2025

              Mar 15        Mar 16        Mar 17
R1-R2           45%           45%           45%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There is an increased chance for M-class flaring (R1-R2,
Minor-Moderate) on 15-17 Mar.
