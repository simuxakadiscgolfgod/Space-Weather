A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 26-Mar 28 2025 is 5.67 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 26-Mar 28 2025

             Mar 26       Mar 27       Mar 28
00-03UT       5.67 (G2)    4.00         3.00

09-12UT       3.67         3.67         3.00     
12-15UT       4.33         3.67         3.00     
15-18UT       3.67         4.00         3.00     
18-21UT       4.00         4.00         3.33     
21-00UT       5.00 (G1)    3.67         3.67     

Rationale: G2 (Moderate) geomagnetic storming is likely on 26 Mar and G1
(Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 27 Mar due to positive
polarity CH HSS effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 26-Mar 28 2025

              Mar 26  Mar 27  Mar 28
S1 or greater    5%      5%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 26-Mar 28 2025

              Mar 26        Mar 27        Mar 28
R1-R2           30%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            1%

Rationale: A chance for R1 (Minor) radio blackouts due to isolated
M-class flares will persist through 28 Mar.
