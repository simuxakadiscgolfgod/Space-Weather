A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for May 22-May 24 2025 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown May 22-May 24 2025

             May 22       May 23       May 24
00-03UT       2.67         2.00         1.67     
03-06UT       2.00         2.00         1.33

09-12UT       2.33         2.67         1.33     
12-15UT       2.33         2.67         1.33     
15-18UT       2.33         4.00         1.33     
18-21UT       2.33         2.67         1.67     
21-00UT       2.67         2.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected. 
Unsettled to active levels are forecast on 22-23 May due to persistent
CH HSS effects along with a possible glancing influence from the 17 May
CME.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for May 22-May 24 2025

              May 22  May 23  May 24
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for May 22-May 24 2025

              May 22        May 23        May 24
R1-R2           25%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: Solar flare activity is expected to remain low as most
regions on the disk are fairly simple in their magnetic complexities.
There remains a 25% chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) and a 5% chance
for R3 (Strong) activity through 24 May.
