A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 04-Nov 06 2024 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 04-Nov 06 2024

             Nov 04       Nov 05       Nov 06
00-03UT       3.00         2.67         1.33

09-12UT       2.67         2.00         1.33     
12-15UT       2.00         1.67         1.33     
15-18UT       1.67         1.00         1.67     
18-21UT       2.00         1.67         1.67     
21-00UT       2.00         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 04-Nov 06 2024

              Nov 04  Nov 05  Nov 06
S1 or greater   20%     10%      5%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton
flux to remain elevated but below the threshold over 04-05 Nov.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Nov 03 2024 1524 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 04-Nov 06 2024

              Nov 04        Nov 05        Nov 06
R1-R2           75%           65%           50%
R3 or greater   30%           20%           10%

Rationale: M-class (R1-minor) are expected, with a chance for X-class
(R3-strong), on 04 Nov. On 05 Nov, M-class (R1-minor) activity is likely
and a slight chance for X-class (R3-strong) activity. On 06 Nov, there
is a chance for M-class (R1-minor) activity and a slight chance for
X-class (R3-strong) activity.
