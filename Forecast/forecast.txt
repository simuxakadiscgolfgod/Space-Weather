A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 31-Apr 02 2024 is 3.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 31-Apr 02 2024

             Mar 31       Apr 01       Apr 02
00-03UT       2.00         2.67         2.33     
03-06UT       2.00         2.00         3.00

09-12UT       2.00         2.33         2.00     
12-15UT       3.00         2.33         1.67     
15-18UT       3.00         2.33         1.33     
18-21UT       2.00         2.33         2.00     
21-00UT       2.00         2.67         2.00     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 31-Apr 02 2024

              Mar 31  Apr 01  Apr 02
S1 or greater   10%      5%      5%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms on 31 Mar due to the flare potential for Region 3615.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Mar 30 2024 2116 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 31-Apr 02 2024

              Mar 31        Apr 01        Apr 02
R1-R2           65%            1%            1%
R3 or greater   15%            1%            1%

Rationale: Due to the flare potential of Region 3615, R1-R2
(Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a chance for R3
(Strong), over 31 Mar. Probabilities decrease for 01-02 Apr as
Region 3615 rotates beyond the western limb.
