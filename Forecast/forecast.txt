A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Aug 16-Aug 18 2024 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       2.67         4.33         4.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms likely on 18 Aug during the
anticipated passage of a CME that left the Sun on 14 Aug.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Aug 16-Aug 18 2024

              Aug 16  Aug 17  Aug 18
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: A slight chance for S1 (Minor) conditions exist through 18
Aug from the flare potential of multiple complex regions on the visible
disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Aug 15 2024 0348 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Aug 16-Aug 18 2024

              Aug 16        Aug 17        Aug 18
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected through
18 Aug due to the flare potential from multiple regions on the visible
disk.
