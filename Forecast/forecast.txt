A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 22-Nov 24 2023 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 22-Nov 24 2023

             Nov 22       Nov 23       Nov 24
00-03UT       4.33         3.00         2.67

21-00UT       2.67         1.67         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 22-Nov 24 2023

              Nov 22  Nov 23  Nov 24
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 22-Nov 24 2023

              Nov 22        Nov 23        Nov 24
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts will
persist through the forecast period primarily due to Region 3492s
current size and magnetic structure (Dki/Beta-Gamma).
