A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Nov 21-Nov 23 2023 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Nov 21-Nov 23 2023

             Nov 21       Nov 22       Nov 23
00-03UT       1.00         2.00         3.00

12-15UT       2.67         2.00         2.33     
15-18UT       3.00         2.00         1.67     
18-21UT       3.67         4.00         2.67     
21-00UT       3.67         3.00         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Nov 21-Nov 23 2023

              Nov 21  Nov 22  Nov 23
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Nov 20 2023 0903 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Nov 21-Nov 23 2023

              Nov 21        Nov 22        Nov 23
R1-R2           40%           40%           40%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: A chance for R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts will
persist through the forecast period as a complex of regions continues to
rotate on the visible disk. Region 3489 continues to exhibit evolving,
complex magnetic structure as well, adding to the likelihood of an
event.
